/// @notice Interface for all bridged tokens.
/// @dev Here is the list of assumptions that guarantees that the bridged token can be bridged back
/// to it's canonical counterpart (by-default it is, but in case a third-party "native" token is set
/// and used in our bridge):
/// - The token should be ERC-20 compliant
/// - Supply increases should only be caused by mints from the vault. Notably, rebasing tokens are
/// not supported.
/// - Token balances should change by exactly the given amounts on `transfer`/`mint`/`burn`. Notable,
/// tokens with fees on transfers are not supported.
/// - If the bridged token is not directly deployed by the Bridge (ERC20Vault), - for example a USDT
/// token bytecode deployed on Taiko to support native tokens - it might be necessary to implement
/// an intermediary adapter contract which should conform mint() and burn() interfaces, so that the
/// ERC20Vault can call these actions on the adapter.
/// - If the bridged token is not directly deployed by the Bridge (ERC20Vault), but conforms the
/// mint() and burn() interface and the ERC20Vault has the right to perform these actions (has
/// minter/burner role).
/// - If the bridged token is directly deployed by our Bridge (ERC20Vault).
