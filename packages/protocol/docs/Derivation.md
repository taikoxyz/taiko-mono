# Block Derivation in Taiko

This document provides a comprehensive specification for deriving blocks from on-chain proposals in Taiko's Shasta fork.

## Terminology

The Shasta fork introduces refined terminology to better reflect the system's architecture:

- **Proposal**: Replaces the term _Batch_ to denote the unit of on-chain submission for block construction data
- **Finalization**: Replaces _Verification_ to describe the state where a proposal's post-state is confirmed as final

## Metadata Architecture

Block construction requires a comprehensive collection of metadata, organized into two distinct categories:

- **Proposal-level metadata**: Shared across all blocks within a proposal
- **Block-level metadata**: Unique to each individual block

Throughout this document, metadata references follow the notation `metadata.fieldName`.

### Proposal-level Metadata

| **Metadata Component**   | **Description**                                               |

| **basefeeSharingPctg**   | The percentage of base fee paid to coinbase                   |
| **isForcedInclusion**    | Indicates if the proposal is a forced inclusion               |
| **bondInstructionsHash** | Expected cumulative hash after processing bond instructions   |
| **bondInstructions**     | Array of bond credit/debit instructions to be performed on L2 |

### Block-level Metadata

| **Metadata Component** | **Description**                                       |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **number**             | The block number                                      |

| **anchorStateRoot**    | The state root for the block at anchorBlockNumber     |

## Metadata Preparation

The metadata preparation process initiates with a subscription to the inbox's `Proposed` event, which emits a `proposal` object. The proposal structure is defined in the protocol's L1 smart contract as follows:

```solidity
/// @notice Represents a proposal for L2 blocks.
struct Proposal {
  /// @notice Unique identifier for the proposal.
  uint48 id;
  /// @notice Address of the proposer.
  address proposer;
  /// @notice The L1 block timestamp when the proposal was accepted.
  uint48 timestamp;
  /// @notice The L1 block number when the proposal was accepted.
  uint48 originBlockNumber;
  /// @notice Whether the proposal is from a forced inclusion.
  bool isForcedInclusion;
  /// @notice The percentage of base fee paid to coinbase.
  uint8 basefeeSharingPctg;
  /// @notice Blobs that contains the proposal's manifest data.
  LibBlobs.BlobSlice blobSlice;
}
```

The following metadata fields are directly extracted from the `proposal` object:

| Metadata Field                | Value Assignment              |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `metadata.id`                 | `proposal.id`                 |
| `metadata.proposer`           | `proposal.proposer`           |
| `metadata.timestamp`          | `proposal.timestamp`          |
| `metadata.originBlockNumber`  | `proposal.originBlockNumber`  |
| `metadata.basefeeSharingPctg` | `proposal.basefeeSharingPctg` |
| `metadata.isForcedInclusion`  | `proposal.isForcedInclusion`  |

The `blobSlice` field serves as the primary mechanism for locating and validating the proposal's manifest. The manifest structure is defined as follows:

```solidity
/// @notice Represents a signed Ethereum transaction
/// @dev Follows EIP-2718 typed transaction format with EIP-1559 support
struct SignedTransaction {
  uint8 txType;
  uint64 chainId;
  uint64 nonce;
  uint256 maxPriorityFeePerGas;
  uint256 maxFeePerGas;
  uint64 gasLimit;
  address to;
  uint256 value;
  bytes data;
  bytes accessList;
  uint8 v;
  bytes32 r;
  bytes32 s;
}

/// @notice Represents a block manifest
struct BlockManifest {
  /// @notice The timestamp of the block.
  uint48 timestamp;
  /// @notice The coinbase of the block.
  address coinbase;
  /// @notice The anchor block number. This field can be zero, if so, this block will use the
  /// most recent anchor in a previous block.
  uint48 anchorBlockNumber;
  /// @notice The block's gas limit.
  uint48 gasLimit;
  /// @notice The transactions for this block.
  SignedTransaction[] transactions;
}

/// @notice Represents a proposal manifest
struct ProposalManifest {
  bytes proverAuthBytes;
  BlockManifest[] blocks;
}
```

### Proposer and `isLowBondProposal` Validation

To maintain the integrity of the proposal process, the `proposer` address must pass specific validation checks, which include:

- Confirming that the proposer holds a sufficient balance in the L2 BondManager contract.
- Ensuring the proposer is not waiting for exiting.

Should any of these validation checks fail (as determined by the `updateState` function returning `isLowBondProposal = true`), the proposal is replaced with the default manifest, which contains a single empty block with no transactions.

### Manifest Extraction

The `BlobSlice` struct is defined as:

```solidity
/// @notice Represents a frame of data that is stored in multiple blobs. Note the size is
/// encoded as a bytes32 at the offset location.
struct BlobSlice {
  /// @notice The blobs containing the proposal's content.
  bytes32[] blobHashes;
  /// @notice The byte offset of the proposal's content in the containing blobs.
  uint24 offset;
  /// @notice The timestamp when the frame was created.
  uint48 timestamp;
}
```

The `BlobSlice` struct represents binary data distributed across multiple blobs. Processing involves the following steps:

1. **Blob Concatenation**: Concatenate blobs in the order specified by the `blobHashes` array
2. **Version Extraction**: Extract the version number from bytes `[offset, offset+32)` (only version `0x1` is valid for Shasta)
3. **Size Extraction**: Extract the data size from bytes `[offset+32, offset+64)`
4. **Decompression**: Apply ZLIB decompression to the extracted data slice (bytes `[offset+64, offset+64+size)`)
5. **Decoding**: RLP decode the decompressed data into a `ProposalManifest` struct

#### Default Manifest Conditions

A default manifest is returned when any of the following validation criteria fail:

- **Blob validation**: `blobHashes.length` is zero
- **Offset validation**: `offset > BLOB_BYTES * blobHashes.length - 64`
- **Version validation**: Version number is not `0x1`
- **Decompression failure**: ZLIB decompression fails
- **Decoding failure**: RLP decoding fails
- **Block count validation**: `manifest.blocks.length` exceeds `PROPOSAL_MAX_BLOCKS`

The default manifest is one initialized as:

```solidity
ProposalManifest memory default;
default.blocks = new BlockManifest[](1) ;
```

A default manifest contains a single empty block, effectively serving as a fallback mechanism for invalid proposals.

### Metadata Validation and Computation

With the extracted manifest, metadata computation proceeds using both the manifest data and the parent block's metadata (`parent.metadata`). The following sections detail the validation rules for each metadata component:

#### `timestamp` Validation

Timestamp validation is performed collectively across all blocks and may result in block count reduction:

1. **Upper bound enforcement**: If `metadata.timestamp > proposal.timestamp`, set `metadata.timestamp = proposal.timestamp`
2. **Lower bound calculation**: `lowerBound = max(parent.metadata.timestamp + 1, proposal.timestamp - TIMESTAMP_MAX_OFFSET)`
3. **Lower bound enforcement**: If `metadata.timestamp < lowerBound`, set `metadata.timestamp = lowerBound`

#### `anchorBlockNumber` Validation

Anchor block validation ensures proper L1 state synchronization and may trigger manifest replacement:

**Invalidation conditions** (sets `anchorBlockNumber` to `parent.metadata.anchorBlockNumber`):

- **Non-monotonic progression**: `manifest.blocks[i].anchorBlockNumber < parent.metadata.anchorBlockNumber`
- **Future reference**: `manifest.blocks[i].anchorBlockNumber >= proposal.originBlockNumber - ANCHOR_MIN_OFFSET`
- **Excessive lag**: `manifest.blocks[i].anchorBlockNumber < proposal.originBlockNumber - ANCHOR_MAX_OFFSET`

**Forced inclusion protection**: For non-forced proposals (`proposal.isForcedInclusion == false`), if no blocks have valid anchor numbers greater than its parent's, the entire manifest is replaced with the default manifest, penalizing proposals that fail to provide proper L1 anchoring.

#### `anchorBlockHash` and `anchorStateRoot` Validation

The anchor hash and state root must maintain consistency with the anchor block number (enforced by the Taiko node/driver):

- If `anchorBlockNumber == parent.metadata.anchorBlockNumber`: Both `anchorBlockHash` and `anchorStateRoot` must be zero
- Otherwise: Both fields must accurately reflect the L1 block state at the specified `anchorBlockNumber`

#### `coinbase` Assignment

The L2 coinbase address determination follows a hierarchical priority system:

1. **Forced inclusions**: Always use `proposal.proposer`
2. **Regular proposals**: Use `manifest.blocks[i].coinbase` if non-zero
3. **Fallback**: Use `proposal.proposer` if manifest coinbase is `address(0)`

#### `gasLimit` Validation

Gas limit adjustments are constrained by `BLOCK_GAS_LIMIT_MAX_CHANGE` permyriad (units of 1/10,000) per block to ensure economic stability. With the default value of 10 permyriad, this allows ±10 basis points (±0.1%) change per block. Additionally, block gas limit must never fall below `MIN_BLOCK_GAS_LIMIT`:

**Calculation process**:

1. **Define bounds**:

   - `lowerBound = max(parent.metadata.gasLimit * (10000 - BLOCK_GAS_LIMIT_MAX_CHANGE) / 10000, MIN_BLOCK_GAS_LIMIT)`
   - `upperBound = parent.metadata.gasLimit * (10000 + BLOCK_GAS_LIMIT_MAX_CHANGE) / 10000`

2. **Apply constraints**:
   - If `manifest.blocks[i].gasLimit == 0`: Inherit parent value
   - If below `lowerBound`: Clamp to `lowerBound`
   - If above `upperBound`: Clamp to `upperBound`
   - Otherwise: Use manifest value unchanged

#### `bondInstructionsHash` and `bondInstructions` Validation

For an L2 block with a higher anchor block number than its parent, bond instructions must be processed within its anchor transaction.

To begin, obtain the `CoreState` from the L1 anchor block's world state through a storage Merkle proof, verifying that its keccak hash matches the `coreStateHash` stored in the inbox contract. Extract the `bondInstructionsHash` field from this verified `CoreState` and set `metadata.bondInstructionsHash` to this value.

If `metadata.anchorBlockNumber` exceeds `parent.metadata.anchorBlockNumber`, collect all `BondInstructions` emitted from the Taiko inbox via `BondInstructed` events, occurring between blocks numbered `parent.metadata.anchorBlockNumber + 1` and `metadata.anchorBlockNumber`. Assign this collection to `metadata.bondInstructions`, which may be empty.

### Designated Prover System

The designated prover system ensures every L2 block has a responsible prover, maintaining chain liveness even during adversarial conditions. The system operates through the `updateState` function in ShastaAnchor, which manages prover designation on the first block of each proposal (`blockIndex == 0`).

#### Prover Designation Process

##### 1. Authentication and Validation

The `_validateProverAuth` function processes prover authentication data with the following steps:

- **Signature Verification**:

  - Validates minimum data length (161 bytes for a valid `ProverAuth` struct)
  - Decodes the `ProverAuth` containing: `proposalId`, `proposer`, `provingFeeGwei`, and ECDSA `signature`
  - Verifies the signature against the message hash `keccak256(abi.encode(proposalId, proposer, provingFeeGwei))`
  - Returns the recovered signer address and proving fee

- **Validation Failures**: If authentication fails (insufficient data length < 161 bytes, ABI decode failure, invalid signature, or mismatched proposal/proposalId), the system falls back to the proposer address with zero proving fee. Invalid `proverAuthBytes` does NOT trigger a default manifest

##### 2. Bond Sufficiency Assessment

The system evaluates bond adequacy through multiple checks:

- **Proposer Bond Check**: Verifies if the proposer maintains sufficient L2 bonds to cover the proving fee
- **Low-Bond Detection**: Sets `metadata.isLowBondProposal = true` when:
  - The proposer's bond balance falls below the protocol threshold
  - The proposer is in the process of exiting the system
- **Designated Prover Bond Check**: If a different prover is designated, verifies they have sufficient bonds

##### 3. Prover Assignment Logic

The final prover assignment follows a hierarchical fallback mechanism:

```solidity
if (isLowBondProposal) {
    // Inherit the parent block's designated prover
    designatedProver = parent.metadata.designatedProver;
} else if (designatedProver != proposer && !hasSufficientBond(designatedProver)) {
    // Fallback to proposer if designated prover lacks bonds
    designatedProver = proposer;
} else {
    // Use the authenticated prover
    designatedProver = authenticatedProver;
}
```

The assigned prover is stored in contract state and emitted via `ProverDesignated` event.

#### Low-Bond Proposal Handling

Low-bond proposals present a critical challenge: maintaining chain liveness when proposers lack sufficient bonds. The system implements several mitigation strategies:

##### Immediate Mitigations

- **Default Manifest Replacement**: When `isLowBondProposal = true`, the entire manifest is replaced with the default manifest (containing a single empty block with no transactions), minimizing proving costs and disincentivizing spam
- **Prover Persistence**: The designated prover is never `address(0)`, ensuring someone is always responsible
- **Inheritance Mechanism**: Low-bond proposals inherit their parent's designated prover, maintaining continuity

##### Economic Incentives and Penalties

- **Unpaid Proving**: The inherited prover must prove low-bond proposals without earning fees
- **Liveness Bonds**: Failure to prove results in liveness bond penalties
- **Penalty Redistribution**: Forfeited bonds can incentivize other provers to step in

##### System Implications

The current design creates an asymmetric burden where the last legitimate designated prover may need to prove multiple low-bond proposals without compensation. This ensures chain liveness but raises fairness concerns during sustained attacks.

#### Future Improvements

Several enhancements are under consideration to address current limitations:

- **Prover Rotation**: Distribute low-bond proving responsibility across multiple provers using round-robin or stake-weighted selection
- **Reward Pool**: Establish a dedicated fund for compensating low-bond proposal proving
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Adjust bond requirements based on network conditions and attack patterns
- **Alternative Finality**: Explore mechanisms that ensure chain progress without overburdening individual provers

### Additional Metadata Fields

The remaining metadata fields follow straightforward assignment patterns:

| Metadata Field             | Value Assignment                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `metadata.index`           | `parent.metadata.index + 1` (abbreviated as `i`)                  |
| `metadata.number`          | `parent.metadata.number + 1`                                      |
| `metadata.difficulty`      | `keccak(abi.encode(parent.metadata.difficulty, metadata.number))` |
| `metadata.numBlocks`       | `manifest.blocks.length` (post-validation)                        |
| `metadata.proverAuthBytes` | `manifest.proverAuthBytes`                                        |
| `metadata.transactions`    | `manifest.blocks[i].transactions`                                 |

**Important**: The `numBlocks` field must be assigned only after timestamp and anchor block validation completes, as these validations may reduce the effective block count.

## Metadata Application

The validated metadata serves three critical functions in block construction:

1. **Pre-execution block header field determination**
2. **L2 anchor transaction construction**
3. **L2 world state modification**

### Pre-Execution Block Header

Metadata encoding into L2 block header fields facilitates efficient peer validation:

| Metadata Component   | Type    | Header Field                              |
| -------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `number`             | uint256 | `number`                                  |
| `timestamp`          | uint256 | `timestamp`                               |
| `difficulty`         | uint256 | `difficulty`                              |
| `gasLimit`           | uint256 | `gasLimit`                                |
| `basefeeSharingPctg` | uint8   | First byte in `extraData`                 |
| `isLowBondProposal`  | bool    | Lowest bit in the 2nd byte in `extraData` |

#### Additional Pre-Execution Block Header Fields

The following block header fields are also set before transaction execution but are not derived from metadata:

| Header Field | Value                                                                                           |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `parentHash` | Hash of the previous L2 block                                                                   |
| `mixHash`    | TODO: Determine if this should be 0 or set to `prevRandao` as per EIP-4399                      |
| `baseFee`    | Calculated using EIP-4396 from parent and current block timestamps before transaction execution |

Note: Fields like `stateRoot`, `transactionsRoot`, `receiptsRoot`, `logsBloom`, and `gasUsed` are populated after transaction execution.

### Anchor Transaction

The anchor transaction serves as a privileged system transaction responsible for L1 state synchronization and bond instruction processing. It invokes the `updateState` function on the ShastaAnchor contract with precisely defined parameters:

| Parameter            | Type              | Description                                              |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| proposalId           | uint48            | Unique identifier of the proposal being anchored         |
| proposer             | address           | Address of the entity that proposed this batch of blocks |
| proverAuth           | bytes             | Encoded ProverAuth for prover designation                |
| bondInstructionsHash | bytes32           | Expected cumulative hash after processing instructions   |
| bondInstructions     | BondInstruction[] | Bond credit/debit instructions to process for this block |
| blockIndex           | uint16            | Current block index within the proposal (0-based)        |
| anchorBlockNumber    | uint48            | L1 block number to anchor (0 to skip anchoring)          |
| anchorBlockHash      | bytes32           | L1 block hash at anchorBlockNumber                       |
| anchorStateRoot      | bytes32           | L1 state root at anchorBlockNumber                       |

The function returns:

- `isLowBondProposal` (bool): True if proposer has insufficient bonds
- `designatedProver` (address): Address of the designated prover

#### Transaction Execution Flow

The anchor transaction executes a carefully orchestrated sequence of operations:

1. **Fork validation and duplicate prevention**

   - Verifies the current block number is at or after the Shasta fork height
   - Tracks parent block hash to prevent duplicate `updateState` calls within the same block

2. **Proposal initialization** (blockIndex == 0 only)

   - Designates the prover for the proposal
   - Sets `isLowBondProposal` flag based on bond sufficiency
   - Stores designated prover and low-bond status in contract state
   - Emits `ProverDesignated` event

3. **L1 state anchoring and bond processing** (when anchorBlockNumber > previous anchorBlockNumber)
   - Persists L1 block data via `checkpointManager.saveCheckpoint`
   - Processes bond instructions (NONE, LIVENESS, and PROVABILITY types) where NONE results in no transfer
   - Maintains cumulative hash integrity by chaining: `keccak256(previousHash, instruction)` (skips if proposalId=0 or bondType=NONE)
   - Updates anchor state atomically (bondInstructionsHash and anchorBlockNumber)

**Execution constraints**:

- Gas limit: Exactly 1,000,000 gas (enforced by the Taiko node software)
- Caller restriction: Golden touch address (system account) only

### Transaction Execution

## Base Fee Calculation

The calculation of block base fee shall follow [EIP-4396](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-4396.md#specification).
