# relayer

A relayer for the Bridge to watch and sync event between Layer 1 and Taiko Layer 2.

## Layout

### bin

Executable binary, built it with `go build cmd/main.go {options}`.

### cli

Command line interface execution folder, intended to instantiate all app dependencies and start them.

### cmd

Entry point to the application. There are possible flag configurations for the app. Run `go run cmd/main.go -h` to see possible options, or `go run cmd/main.go` to run it with sensible defaults.

### contracts

Autogenerated smart contract bindings with `abigen`. Use `./abigen.sh` to generate the bindings.

### encoding

Encoding helpers for packing abi structs or converting types.

### indexer

A block indexing service that watches for events happening in batches.

### message

A message processor that can act on a specific event and attempt to process them via `bridge.processMessage` call.

### migrations

Contains database migrations. They are created and ran with the `goose` binary.

`cd migrations`

`GOOSE_DRIVER=mysql GOOSE_DBSTRING="username:password@/dbname" goose up`

### mock

Mocked structs for testing.

### proof

Proof generator, uses `eth_getProof` call under the hood.
