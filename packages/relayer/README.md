[![Relayer](https://codecov.io/gh/taikoxyz/taiko-mono/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=E468X2PTJC&flag=relayer)](https://codecov.io/gh/taikoxyz/taiko-mono)

# Relayer

A relayer for the Bridge to watch and sync events between Layer 1 and Taiko Layer 2.

## Build the Source

To build the source, ensure you have an updated Go compiler installed. Run the following command to compile the executable:

```sh
go build -o relayer ./cmd/
```

## Configuration

### Configure MySQL and RabbitMQ

Before configuring environment variables, ensure that you have MySQL and RabbitMQ instances running. Replace the `MYSQL_` environment variables with your specific configurations.

RabbitMQ can be installed using the provided script:

```sh
./scripts/install-rabbitmq.sh
```

Alternatively, use Docker Compose to set up MySQL and RabbitMQ in your local environment:

```sh
cd ./docker-compose
docker-compose up
```

To migrate the database schema in MySQL:

```sh
cd ./migrations
goose mysql "<user>:<password>@tcp(localhost:3306)/relayer" status
goose mysql "<user>:<password>@tcp(localhost:3306)/relayer" up
```

### Configure Environment Variables

Environment variables are crucial for the configuration of the Relayerâ€™s processor and indexer. These variables are set in environment files, which are then loaded by the Relayer at runtime.

#### Setting up the Processor:

1. **Create the Environment File for the Processor**:
   Copy the example processor environment file to a new file:

   ```sh
   cp .l1processor.example.env .l1processor.env
   ```

   Modify `.l1processor.env` as necessary to suit your environment settings.

2. **Run the Processor**:
   Before running the processor, specify which environment file it should use by setting the `RELAYER_ENV_FILE` environment variable:
   ```sh
   export RELAYER_ENV_FILE=./.l1processor.env
   ```
   Now, you can run the processor:
   ```sh
   ./relayer processor
   ```

#### Setting up the Indexer:

1. **Create the Environment File for the Indexer**:
   Copy the example indexer environment file to a new file:

   ```sh
   cp .l1indexer.example.env .l1indexer.env
   ```

   Edit `.l1indexer.env` to reflect your specific configurations.

2. **Run the Indexer**:
   Set the `RELAYER_ENV_FILE` to point to the indexer's environment file:
   ```sh
   export RELAYER_ENV_FILE=./.l1indexer.env
   ```
   Execute the indexer:
   ```sh
   ./relayer indexer
   ```

## Usage

To review all available sub-commands, use:

```sh
./relayer --help
```

To review each sub-command's command line flags, use:

```sh
./relayer <sub-command> --help
```
