| Parameter        | Ethereum       | Taiko Alethia                 | Reasoning                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Block gas limit  | 36,000,000 gas | 240,000,000 gas               | Currently in Raiko, memory use scales linearly with block size both in the host (witness generation) and in the guest (memory use inside the VM/program being proven) so we set the block gas limit to 240m gas. |
| Block gas target | 18,000,000 gas | 40,000,000 gas (per L1 block) | Assuming an L2 block time of ~3 seconds will have a ~15,000,000 gas target.                                                                                                                                      |
| Block time       | 12 seconds     | 12-20~ seconds                | This value is variable and will change as of based preconfirmations.                                                                                                                                             |
