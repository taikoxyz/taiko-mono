## Cooldown Window, Proving Window and Bonds

This segment lists the cooldown windows and proving windows for every tier of proof in the Taiko Alethia protocol.

The cooldown window describes how long after the proof has been provided that the block is verified.

The proving window describes how long a prover has to provide a proof for a block after they have been assigned the block (i.e. a block has been proposed with them as the assigned prover).

You can find all the corresponding values below for Taiko Alethia in the [deployed TierProviderBase contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x44d307a9ec47aA55a7a30849d065686753C86Db6#code#F3#L1)!

Currently, the ZK coverage of our prover is set to 15% (8% SP1, 7% R0). We will be increasing this percentage in the coming days.

You can keep track of the actual overall coverage over the past seven days with [this Dune query](https://dune.com/queries/4809870) visible on our dashboard.

If the function of the bonds is not clear to you, please find out more [here](/resources/terminology#key-takeaways).
