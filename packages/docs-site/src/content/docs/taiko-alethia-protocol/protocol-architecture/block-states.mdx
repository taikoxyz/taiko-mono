import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

A block in Taiko Alethia transitions through different states as it progresses through the protocol. The key states are:

- **Proposed**: The block has been submitted to the TaikoInbox contract.
- **Proved**: At least one validity proof has been submitted.
- **Verified**: The block and all its ancestors up to genesis have valid proofs.

Taiko Alethia allows parallel proof generation, meaning multiple blocks can be proved concurrently. However, a block is considered verified only when its parent block is also verified. Blocks are verified in batches, not sequentially.

## Safe and Finalized Block States

### Safe Block
The **Safe** block state on Taiko Alethia is equivalent to a **Safe** block on Ethereum.

Each L2 block originates from an L1 block that can be queried using the [`taiko-geth API`](https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-geth/blob/v1.8.0/eth/taiko_api_backend.go#L50). If the corresponding L1 block is considered Safe, the associated L2 block can also be considered Safe.

#### Querying L1 Origin for an L2 Block
The following **taiko-geth API method** retrieves the **L1 origin** of a given Taiko Alethia L2 block:

<Code code='
func (s *TaikoAPIBackend) L1OriginByID(blockID *math.HexOrDecimal256) (*rawdb.L1Origin, error) {
    l1Origin, err := rawdb.ReadL1Origin(s.eth.ChainDb(), (*big.Int)(blockID))
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    if l1Origin == nil {
        return nil, ethereum.NotFound
    }
    return l1Origin, nil
}
' lang="go" title="L1OriginByID API" />

### Finalized (Verified) Block

The **Verified** block state in Taiko Alethia is analogous to the **Finalized** block state in Ethereum. A block is Verified when:

- Every state transition from genesis to the current block has valid proofs.
- Its parent block is also verified.
- The block is included in a batch verification process.

A Verified block cannot be reverted, ensuring **strong finality guarantees**.

## Example API Query and Response

The following JSON-RPC request retrieves the L1 origin for a given L2 block:

<Code code='
{
    "method": "taiko_l1OriginByID",
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "params": ["0x19a3c"]
}' lang="json" title="query.json" />

### Response
<Code code='
"result": {
    "blockID": "0x19a3c",
    "l2BlockHash": "0x0905c85f9a288ebe94eb85743a65c8cf6266097b8b826cdca4f4018e6267c26a",
    "l1BlockHeight": "0x16ef0f",
    "l1BlockHash": "0x419f0c5b2cc90078c7040c3b90d174895ce83d76ebfdd75ad2dd5521036d0938"
}' lang="json" title="response.json" />

---

### Interpreting the Response
For block `0x19a3c`:
- It is **Safe** if the **L1 block (`0x419f..`)** reaches a **Safe** state.
- It is **Finalized (Verified)** if **all state transitions from genesis to block `0x19a3c`** have **valid proofs**.
