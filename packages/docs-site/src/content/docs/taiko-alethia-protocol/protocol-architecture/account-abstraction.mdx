Security and UX limits have stood as a constant barrier to expanding blockchain to a wider audience. ERC4337/Account Abstraction is the software layer that enables “smart” crypto accounts with a more seamless, Web2-like UX as a way to encourage mass adoption of blockchain technology.

## ERC-4337 Support on Taiko Alethia

Account Abstraction via Entry Point Contract specification is a specification that aims to use an entry point contract to achieve account abstraction without changing the consensus layer protocol of Ethereum.

Taiko Alethia supports the ERC-4337 specification, and has deployed the singleton [Entrypoint contract](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/blob/develop/contracts/core/EntryPoint.sol) implementation by `eth-infinitism`.

It is deployed at
[0x7ad92b2e90dc6CAb35AD2524F6401297aD7D7B50](https://taikoscan.io/address/0x4337084D9E255Ff0702461CF8895CE9E3b5Ff108) and users are enocuraged to build with it for their account abstraction needs!
