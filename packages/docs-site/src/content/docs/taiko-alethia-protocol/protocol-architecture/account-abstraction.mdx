TL;DR

Security and UX limits have stood as a constant barrier to expanding blockchain to a wider audience.
The solution? account abstraction (AA), the software layer that enables “smart” crypto accounts with a more seamless, Web2-like UX.
While also possible on Ethereum, AA is the default setting on Starknet. With Starknet’s native AA, every account on the network is a smart account.
