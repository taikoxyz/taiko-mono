Ethereum is **expensive** and **congested**. However, Ethereum's core principles—**censorship resistance, permissionless access, and robust security**—are **non-negotiable**. A true scaling solution must **extend** these properties without introducing trust assumptions, centralization, or trade-offs.

## Introducing Taiko Alethia

Taiko Alethia is an **Ethereum-equivalent, permissionless, based rollup** designed to scale Ethereum without compromising its fundamental properties. Unlike traditional rollups that rely on centralized sequencers, Taiko Alethia leverages Ethereum itself for sequencing, ensuring that block ordering is decentralized and censorship-resistant.

### Why Taiko Alethia?

- **Fully Ethereum-equivalent**: Runs an unmodified Ethereum execution layer, making it easy for developers to migrate smart contracts and tooling.
- **No centralized sequencer**: Ethereum L1 validators naturally order transactions in a decentralized way.
- **Multiproving architecture**: Supports ZK proofs and Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) proofs making it more flexible than single-proof rollups.
- **Configurable proof system**: Can operate as a ZK-rollup, optimistic rollup, or hybrid, depending on security and performance trade-offs.
- **Decentralized proving & proposing**: Permissionless block proposing and proving, eliminating reliance on whitelisted actors.

### Key Concepts in Taiko Alethia

- [Based rollup](/taiko-alethia-protocol/protocol-design/based-rollups): A rollup where Ethereum L1 validators sequence blocks, removing the need for a centralized sequencer.

## How Taiko Alethia Works

At its core, Taiko Alethia is a set of smart contracts deployed on Ethereum L1 that enforce execution rules, manage proofs, and facilitate rollup operations.

- **Proposing batches**: Transactions are proposed permissionlessly by anyone following Ethereum’s sequencing rules.
- **Proving batches**: Provers submit validity proofs (TEE + TEE, or ZK + TEE) to confirm the correctness of proposed blocks in a batch.

## Taiko Alethia Governance & Organizations

### Decentralized Organizations

Taiko Alethia operates as a fully decentralized protocol governed by **DAOs, community-run validators, and decentralized incentives**.

## Why Taiko Alethia is Superior to Traditional Rollups

| Feature                        | Traditional Rollups                  | Taiko Alethia                          |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **Sequencing**                 | Centralized (single sequencer)       | Decentralized (L1 validators sequence) |
| **Proof System**               | Single proof type (ZK or Optimistic) | Multiproving (TEE + TEE or TEE +ZK)    |
| **Censorship Resistance**      | Operator can censor transactions     | Permissionless transaction inclusion   |
| **Smart Contract Equivalence** | Modified Ethereum (Geth changes)     | 100% Ethereum-equivalent               |
| **Decentralization**           | Relies on multisig governance        | DAO-controlled with open participation |

Taiko Alethia follows Ethereum’s decentralization ethos by ensuring L1 validators remain in control, minimizing trust assumptions, and maximizing rollup neutrality.
