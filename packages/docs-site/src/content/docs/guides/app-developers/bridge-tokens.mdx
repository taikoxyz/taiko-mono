<Aside>
  Please be aware, bridging back to L1 will take up to 24 hours! See [network
  configuration](/network-reference/network-configuration) for the currently
  configured cooldown period. The time taken may be greater than the cooldown
  period due to previous unverified parent blocks, but each bridge should
  generally resolve within 24 hours.
