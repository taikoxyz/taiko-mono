<Aside>
Please be aware, bridging back to L1 will take up to 24 hours! See [network configuration](/network-reference/network-configuration) for the currently configured cooldown period. The time taken may be greater than the cooldown period due to previous unverified parent blocks, but each bridge should generally resolve within 24 hours.
