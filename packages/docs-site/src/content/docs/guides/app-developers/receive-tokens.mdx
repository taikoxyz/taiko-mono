This guide will help you receive **testnet** tokens on Holesky and Taiko.

## Prerequisites

- You have a wallet installed (e.g., [Rabby](https://rabby.io/), [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)).

## Receive some Holesky testnet Ether

Taiko Hekla is currently deployed on Holesky testnet. Check out [faucetlink.to](https://faucetlink.to/) for a list of Holesky ether faucets!

## Receive some Taiko Hekla testnet tokens

HORSE is a dummy testnet token we deployed on Taiko Hekla. You can see all deployed contracts [here](/network-reference/contract-addresses). Navigate to the [bridge](https://bridge.hekla.taiko.xyz) and click "Faucet" on the sidebar to receive some HORSE.

## Receive some TTKOh

<Aside>
In order to receive TTKOh you need to have an SGX prover setup. We are working on an easy Docker setup to run the images if you have an SGX machine, and after verifying that you have an SGX machine we can send some TTKOh. Stay tuned for that!
