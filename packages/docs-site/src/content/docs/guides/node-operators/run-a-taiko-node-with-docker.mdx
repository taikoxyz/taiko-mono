This guide will help you start up a Taiko RPC node using <NewTabLink href="https://github.com/taikoxyz/simple-taiko-node" text="simple-taiko-node"/>.

## Software Dependencies

| Dependency                                                                | Version  | Version Check Command |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | --------------------- |
| <NewTabLink href="https://git-scm.com/" text="git"/>                      | `^2`     | `git --version`       |
| <NewTabLink href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/" text="Docker"/>| `^24.0`  | `docker --version`    |

## Prerequisites

- If using Windows, you should install <NewTabLink href="https://gitforwindows.org/" text="Git BASH"/> or <NewTabLink href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install" text="WSL"/> to use as your terminal.
- Meet the <NewTabLink href="https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum#hardware-requirements" text="Geth minimum hardware requirements"/> except for the storage requirement because Taiko nodes will require less storage (at the time of writing).

## Run a Taiko node with simple-taiko-node

<Steps>

1. Clone simple-taiko-node

    <Tabs>
      <TabItem label="Mac/Linux">
        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/taikoxyz/simple-taiko-node.git
        cd simple-taiko-node
        ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="Windows">
        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/taikoxyz/simple-taiko-node.git
        cd simple-taiko-node && git config core.autocrlf false
        ```
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

2. Copy the sample .env files

    <Aside title="Info">
    To run a `hekla` Taiko node please copy `.env.sample.hekla` instead of `.env.sample`.
    </Aside>

    ```sh
    cp .env.sample .env
    ```

3. Set the L1 node endpoint

    First, open the `.env` in your preferred text editor:

    <Tabs>
      <TabItem label="Mac/Linux">
        ```sh
        nano .env
        ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="Windows">
        ```sh
        notepad .env
        ```
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    <Aside>
    You can use any L1 endpoint to run a Taiko L1 node unless you want to prove blocks past the last 128 blocks, in which case you will need an archive node.

    It's recommended to [run a local L1 node](/guides/node-operators/run-an-ethereum-testnet-node) but you browse around for other RPC Providers. Keep in mind they will **eventually rate limit your node** and it will stop syncing, so a local L1 node is recommended for a proper setup.

    For Mainnet, the L1 Node will need to be an Ethereum node; for Testnet, the L1 Node will need to be a Etherem testnet (Holesky) node.
    </Aside>

    Next, you will set the L1 node endpoints. If you are running a local L1 node, you cannot reference the L1 endpoints as `http://127.0.0.1:8545`, `ws://127.0.0.1:8546` and `http://127.0.0.1:5052` because that is local to inside the simple-taiko-node Docker networking. Instead you can try:

    - Using `host.docker.internal` (see: <NewTabLink href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24319662" text="stack overflow"/>).
    - Using the private ip address of your machine (use something like `ip addr show` to get this ip address).

    After getting the address of the L1 node, set the following L1 node endpoints in your `.env` file. Here is an example:

    - `L1_ENDPOINT_HTTP=http://192.168.1.15:8545`
    - `L1_ENDPOINT_WS=ws://192.168.1.15:8546`
    - `L1_BEACON_HTTP=http://192.168.1.15:5052`

4. Remove old testnet volumes

    If you ran a testnet node previously, make sure to first remove the old volumes:

    ```sh
    docker compose down -v
    ```

5. Set the profiles you want to run

    In your `.env`, please set `COMPOSE_PROFILES` to whichever set of services you'd like to run in a comma separated list (i.e., `l2_execution_engine,proposer,prover` or any combination of the three).

    Note that if you include `proposer` or `prover`, the services will still be disabled if you do not set `ENABLE_PROPOSER=true` or `ENABLE_PROVER=true` respectively.

6. Start the node

    <Aside title="Info">
    Make sure Docker is running and then run the following command to start the node (you may need to use `sudo docker compose up -d` if your user is not in the `docker` group):

    To run a `hekla` Taiko node please use the following command instead: `docker compose -f docker-compose-hekla.yml up -d`.
    </Aside>

    ```sh
    docker compose up -d
    ```

7. Verify node is running

    #### Option 1: Check with the node dashboard

    A node dashboard will be running on `localhost` on the `GRAFANA_PORT` you set in your `.env` file, which defaults to `3001`: <NewTabLink href="http://localhost:3001/d/L2ExecutionEngine/l2-execution-engine-overview" text="http://localhost:3001/d/L2ExecutionEngine/l2-execution-engine-overview"/>.

    You can verify that your node is syncing by checking that the **chain head** on the dashboard is increasing. Once the chain head matches what's on the block explorer, you are fully synced.

    #### Option 2: Check with curl commands

    <Steps>

    1. Check if the Execution Layer client is connected to Taiko L2:

        ```bash
        curl http://localhost:8547 \
          -X POST \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          --data '{"method":"eth_chainId","params":[],"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}'
        ```

        which should return the chainId as `0x28c61` (167009):

        ```json
        { "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "result": "0x28c61" }
        ```

    2. Check if the Execution Layer client is synced by requesting the latest Taiko L2 / L3 block from the Execution Layer client:

        ```bash
        curl http://localhost:8547 \
          -X POST \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          --data '{"method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}'
        ```

    3. If the blockNumber response value is `0` or not growing, check the Taiko L2 logs here:

        ```bash
        docker compose logs -f
        ```

        > Note: You may need to use `sudo docker compose logs -f` if you are not in the `docker` group.

    </Steps>

</Steps>

## Video tutorial

See the video tutorial <NewTabLink href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_tVvDcuK5o" text="Run a Taiko L2 node (YouTube)"/>. It's for a previous testnet but the overall steps are the same!
