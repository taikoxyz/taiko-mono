title: Deploy a ProverSet
description: This guide will you help you deploy a ProverSet which enables you to use 2 separate EOAs to propose and prove blocks with the new protocol design.
---

import { Aside, Card, Steps, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

The recent protocol upgrade now requires that the address of the prover and proposer are the same. This can be achieved by simply using the same private keys to run the proposer and prover software,
but this is not recommended as it can cause nonce issues.

This guide outlines how to achieve this with separate EOAs running prover and proposer through the ProverSet smart contract.

## Prerequisites

- You have TAIKO or TTKOh depending on which network you are proving on
- You have enough ETH or holesky ETH for gas fees

## Deploying a ProverSet

<Steps>

1. **Clone the Taiko Alethia monorepo**

    The [Taiko Alethia monorepo](https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-mono) contains the scripts for deploying your `ProverSet`. Checkout the latest stable release. (Use `taiko-alethia-protocol-v2.2.0` for Taiko Hekla, )

    <Tabs>
        <TabItem label="Mac/Linux">
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-mono.git
        cd taiko-mono/packages/protocol
        git checkout tags/{release-tag}
        ```
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="Windows">
        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-mono.git
        cd taiko-mono/packages/protocol && git config core.autocrlf false
        git checkout tags/{release-tag}
        ```
        </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

2. **Deploy the ProverSet**

    Set `PROVER_SET_ADMIN` or `ADMIN` to the address of your **prover** EOA, `OWNER` to your **proposer** EOA. You will be able to withdraw TAIKO/TTKOh from the contract to this address.

    Run the `DeployProverSet.s.sol` script with your **proposer's private key**.

    <Tabs>
      <TabItem label="Taiko Alethia">
      ```bash
      PROVER_SET_ADMIN={ADDRESS} ROLLUP_ADDRESS_MANAGER=0x579f40D0BE111b823962043702cabe6Aaa290780 forge script --chain-id 1 --rpc-url {YOUR_RPC_URL} --private-key {PRIVATE_KEY} --broadcast script/layer1/DeployProverSet.s.sol:DeployProverSet
      ```

      The script should print your implementation and proxy address with the log:

      ```
      Deployed ProverSet impl at address: 0x....
      Deployed ProverSet proxy at address: 0x....
      ```

      Use proxy address for the following steps.
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="Taiko Hekla">
      ```bash
      PRIVATE_KEY={PRIVATE_KEY} OWNER={OWNER_ADDRESS} ADMIN={ADMIN_ADDRESS} TAIKO_TOKEN=0x6490E12d480549D333499236fF2Ba6676C296011 ENTRYPOINT=0x8698690dEeDB923fA0A674D3f65896B0031BF7c9 INBOX=0x79C9109b764609df928d16fC4a91e9081F7e87DB forge script --evm-version cancun --chain-id 17000 --rpc-url {YOUR_RPC_URL} --broadcast script/layer1/mainnet/DeployProverSet.s.sol
      ```

      The script if run correctly will print the following logs:

      ```
      == Logs ==
         proxy   : 0x.....
         impl    : 0x.....
         owner   : 0x.....
         chain id: 17000
      ```

      Use proxy address for the following steps.
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

3. **Verify the contract as a proxy on Etherscan**

    Navigate to the `proxyAddress` logged as output of the script above in Etherscan.

    In the `Contract` tab, you can find the `More options` section as follows:

    ![Verify as Proxy](~/assets/content/docs/guides/verify-as-proxy.webp)

    Select the `Is this a proxy?` option and follow the instructions. This should verify the contract as a proxy to your `ProverSet` implementation.

4. **Write to the Proxy to `enableProver()`**

    If the above step was completed correctly, you should be able to see the `Write as Proxy` option in the `Contract` tab.

    Connect to Etherscan with the EOA you used to deploy the ProverSet and send two `enableProver()` transactions, enabling **both** your `proposer` and `prover` EOAs as provers. Set `isProver` as `true` for both transactions. You can set these as `false` if you want to disable these provers in the future.

    <Aside type="caution">
        Enable both your proposer and prover addresses here! If you don't, your proposeBlock transactions may fail.
    </Aside>

    This will allow both EOAs to send transactions to your ProverSet implementation which will act as a proxy to TaikoL1.

5. **Configure the contract as necessary**

    Manage the contract's allowance with [approveAllowance()](https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-mono/blob/taiko-alethia-protocol-v1.11.0/packages/protocol/contracts/layer1/provers/ProverSet.sol#L68). TaikoL1's contract allowance is by default set to `UINT256.MAX` in the init function.

6. **Deposit your tokens and run your proposer + prover as usual!**

    If you've followed the instructions, send your TAIKO/TTKOh to the ProverSet proxy and begin running your prover and proposer as usual. If you've set up your allowance properly, there should be no need to use the `depositBond` function, as it deposits TTKOh from the ProverSet to TaikoL1.

    <Aside>
        Make sure to set your `$PROVER_SET` in your `simple-taiko-node` .env file as the proxy address.
    </Aside>

    Ensure that you have set up the EOAs correctly to avoid problems.

    <Aside>
    You can withdraw the deposited tokens to the `admin` address with [withdrawToAdmin()](https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-mono/blob/taiko-alethia-protocol-v1.11.0/packages/protocol/contracts/layer1/provers/ProverSet.sol#L83).
    </Aside>

</Steps>

## Upgrading a ProverSet

If you've already deployed a ProverSet but would like to upgrade it through the Proxy, this guide is for you!

<Aside type="tip">
  If you are getting revert errors when calling `upgradeTo()` on your proxy, check that `owner()` returns the EOA address you are calling the function from. If it doesn't, you will be unable to upgrade and instead will have to redeploy the proxy and implementation with the guide above.
</Aside>

<Steps>

1. **Find your existing Proxy's address**

    This will be necessary for the following step.

2. **Navigate to the Taiko Alethia monorepo and checkout the release version of ProverSet you want to deploy.**

    ```bash
    cd taiko-mono/packages/protocol
    git checkout tags/{PROTOCOL_RELEASE_TAG}
    ```

3. **Deploy the ProverSet contract from your prover EOA and call upgradeTo with the new implementation address on your original Proxy**

    Execute the following command, filling in the values in the curly braces appropriately.

    <Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Taiko Alethia">
    ```bash
    forge create --private-key {YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY} --chain-id 1 --rpc-url {YOUR_RPC_URL} contracts/layer1/provers/ProverSet.sol:ProverSet
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Taiko Hekla">
    ```bash
    forge create --private-key {YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY} --chain-id 17000 --evm-version cancun --rpc-url {YOUR_RPC_URL} contracts/layer1/provers/ProverSet.sol:ProverSet --broadcast --constructor-args 0x3C82907B5895DB9713A0BB874379eF8A37aA2A68 0x79C9109b764609df928d16fC4a91e9081F7e87DB 0x6490E12d480549D333499236fF2Ba6676C296011 0x8698690dEeDB923fA0A674D3f65896B0031BF7c9
    ```
    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    <Aside>
    If you are getting EvmErrors, your private key may be formatted incorrectly; try prefixing it with `0x` and rerunning the script.

    Depending on the protocol release you use, the path to the ProverSet contract may also be different; change as necessary!
    </Aside>

    You should see logs like these:

    ```
    Deployer: 0x3e5c...
    Deployed to: 0x9186...
    Transaction hash: 0xf0ebb...
    ```

    Then, proceed to your original Proxy contract; access the `Write to Proxy` tab and scroll to the `upgradeTo()` function.

    Connect your EOA that you originally deployed the ProverSet from and call the function with your new `Deployed to:` address.

    Once the transaction succeeds, you have successfully upgraded your ProverSet.

</Steps>

## FAQ

### Where is my TTKOh/TAIKO?

    If you've managed to propose and prove some blocks, it's likely you're wondering where your tokens went after.

    It's not missing, it's just been deposited as bond in the TaikoL1 contract; you can withdraw it to the ProverSet contract with [withdrawBond()](https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-mono/blob/taiko-alethia-protocol-v1.11.0/packages/protocol/contracts/layer1/provers/ProverSet.sol#L151) manually.

### How do I verify my ProverSet contract?

    Once you've deployed the contract, you should be able to find the contract address. You can do this on Etherscan manually or with forge!

    You will need foundry installed, and an Etherscan API key; you can get this by signing in on `etherscan.io` and navigating to your profile's `API Keys`.
    Then, navigate to the `protocol` package in `taiko-mono` and execute the following command substituting values in curly braces as necessary.

    ```bash
    forge verify-contract --chain-id {CHAIN_ID} --etherscan-api-key {GET-API-KEY-FROM-ETHERSCAN-FIRST} {PUT-CONTRACT-ADDRESS-HERE} contracts/layer1/provers/ProverSet.sol:ProverSet
    ```

    You should get a success message and your contract should now show up as verified on Etherscan!
