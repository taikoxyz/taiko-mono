title: Deploy a ProverSet
description: This guide will you help you deploy a ProverSet which enables you to use 2 separate EOAs to propose and prove blocks with the new protocol design.

The recent protocol upgrade now requires that the address of the prover and proposer are the same. This can be achieved by simply using the same private keys to run the proposer and prover softwares,
but this is not recommended as it can cause nonce issues. 

This guide outlines how to achieve this with separate EOAs running prover and proposer through the ProverSet smart contract.

## Prerequisites

- You have set up a prover and proposer with the guides in our documentation
- You have TAIKO or TTKOh depending on which network you are proving on
- You have enough ETH for gas fees

## Deploying a ProverSet

<Steps>

1. **Clone the Taiko monorepo**

    The [Taiko monorepo](https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-mono) contains the scripts for deploying your `ProverSet`.

    <Tabs>
        <TabItem label="Mac/Linux">
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-mono.git
        cd taiko-mono/packages/protocol
        ```
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="Windows">
        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-mono.git
        cd taiko-mono/packages/protocol && git config core.autocrlf false
        ```
        </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

2. **Deploy the ProverSet implementation**

    Run the `DeployProverSetUtil.s.sol` script with your **proposer's private key**. You can find the script [here](https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-mono/tree/main/packages/protocol/script/DeployProverSetUtil.s.sol).
    
    ```bash
    forge script --chain-id 17000 --broadcast --rpc-url {YOUR_RPC_URL} --private-key=$PRIVATE_KEY script/DeployProverSetUtil.s.sol:DeployProverSetUtil
    ```

    The script should print your implementation address with the log:

    `New impl address is: 0x....`

    You will need the address for the next step.

3. **Deploy the Proxy and init the ProverSet smart contract**

    Fill in the implentation address, set the **prover** EOA as admin, and ensure that the `ROLLUP_ADDRESS_MANAGER` matches for the respective network. You can find these values in our network reference docs.

    Run the `DeployProverSet.s.sol` script with your **proposer's private key** , altering the values in the script as necessary. You can find the script [here](https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-mono/tree/main/packages/protocol/script/DeployProverSet.s.sol).

    ```bash
    forge script --chain-id 17000 --rpc-url {YOUR_RPC_URL} --private-key=$PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast script/DeployProverSet.s.sol:DeployProverSet
    ```

    The script should print your proxy address with the log:

    `Proxy Address: 0x....`

    Use this address for the following steps.

4. **Verify the contract as a proxy on Etherscan**

    Navigate to the `proxyAddress` logged as output of the script above in Etherscan.

    In the `Contract` tab, you can find the `More options` section as follows:

    ![Verify as Proxy](~/assets/content/docs/guides/verify-as-proxy.webp)

    Select the `Is this a proxy?` option and follow the instructions. This should verify the contract as a proxy to your `ProverSet` implementation.

5. **Write to the Proxy to `enableProver()`**

    If the above step was completed correctly, you should be able to see the `Write as Proxy` option in the `Contract` tab.

    Connect to Etherscan with your **proposer** EOA and send two `enableProver()` transactions, enabling **both** your `proposer` and `prover` EOAs as provers.

    <Aside type="caution">
        Enable both your proposer and prover addresses here! If you don't, your proposeBlock transactions may fail.
    </Aside>

    This will allow both EOAs to send transactions to your ProverSet implementation which will act as a proxy to TaikoL1.

6. **Configure the contract as necessary**

    Manage the contract's allowance with [approveAllowance()](https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-mono/blob/116d3f4886dea01333b829677ec9b6d4492479c6/packages/protocol/contracts/team/proving/ProverSet.sol#L63). TaikoL1's contract allowance is by default set to `UINT256.MAX` in the init function.

7. **Deposit your tokens and run your proposer + prover as usual!**

    If you've followed the instructions, send your TAIKO/TTKOh to the ProverSet proxy and begin running your prover and proposer as usual.

    Ensure that you have set up the EOAs correctly to avoid problems. 

    <Aside>
    You can withdraw the deposited tokens to the `admin` address with [withdrawToAdmin()](https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-mono/blob/116d3f4886dea01333b829677ec9b6d4492479c6/packages/protocol/contracts/team/proving/ProverSet.sol#L76).
