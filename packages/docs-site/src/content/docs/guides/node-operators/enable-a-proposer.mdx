description: This guide will you help you enable your Taiko node as a proposer.

<Aside type="danger">
Do NOT start up your proposer without setting up a prover first with a fully synced node. You WILL lose your tokens and there is no way to recover them without proving the proposed block.
</Aside>

## Prerequisites

- You are already running a Taiko Alethia node [with Docker](/guides/node-operators/run-a-taiko-alethia-node-with-docker) or [from source](/guides/node-operators/build-a-taiko-alethia-node-from-source).
- You have [set up a prover](/guides/node-operators/enable-a-prover) or [configured a ProverSet](/guides/node-operators/deploy-a-proverset) with a third-party partner.

## Using simple-taiko-node

<Aside type="caution">
You can choose to either use a ProverSet, or leave the `PROVER_SET` variable blank. If you leave it blank, you will eventually run into some nonce issues as the proposer and prover will be using the same address. This may be sufficient for testing, but for a longer term proposer / prover setup, we recommend utilizing a ProverSet.

<Aside>
Please note that as we are testing whitelisted preconfirmations on Taiko Hekla, you will no longer be able to run a proposer for Taiko Hekla.
</Aside>

<Steps>

1. First, you will need to [set up a prover](/guides/node-operators/enable-a-prover).

2. If you are using a ProverSet, set the ProverSet contract address in the `PROVER_SET` env variable from the previous guide. Otherwise, leave it blank.

3. Next, set the `L1_PROPOSER_PRIVATE_KEY` to an L1 account's private key which will send the Propose Block transactions. If you are not using a ProverSet, this must be the same private key as your prover.

4. Then, set the `L2_SUGGESTED_FEE_RECIPIENT` to an L2 account's public key that will receive the fee.

5. Finally set `ENABLE_PROPOSER` to `true` in simple-taiko-node `.env`.

6. Set `COMPOSE_PROFILES=proposer` or add proposer to the list.

7. Now that the proposer is configured properly, you can run it with `docker compose up -d`! Please use `docker compose -f docker-compose-hekla.yml up -d` if you are running on Taiko Hekla.
