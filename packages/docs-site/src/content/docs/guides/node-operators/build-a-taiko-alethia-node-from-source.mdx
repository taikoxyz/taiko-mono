This guide shows you how to build your own node from source code.

You might want to do this if you want to run a node on a specific architecture or if you want to inspect the source code of the node you're running.

## Node Components

----------------------------------------------------------------------

A Taiko Alethia Node consists of two components, analogous to an Ethereum node; the consensus client and execution engine.

#### Taiko Client (taiko-client)

The taiko client is responsible for decoding L2 blocks from L1 calldata (and blobspace!), then passing those payloads to our execution engine.

It has three subcommands, `driver`, `prover`, and `proposer`.

The taiko client replaces the [consensus client](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/) in an Ethereum mainnet node.

In this tutorial you will build the `taiko-client` as found in the [Taiko Alethia monorepo](https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-mono).

#### Execution Engine (taiko-geth)

The execution engine is responsible for executing the block payloads it receives from the taiko client. It holds the latest state of the chain.

`taiko-geth` exposes the standard JSON-RPC API that Ethereum developers are familiar with, and can be used accordingly to query blockchain data and submit transactions to the network.

`taiko-geth` replaces the [execution client](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/) in an Ethereum mainnet node.

In this tutorial you will build the `taiko-geth` implementation of `go-ethereum` as found in the [`taiko-geth` repository](https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-geth).

## Software Dependencies

| Dependency                                                    | Version  | Version Check Command |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | --------------------- |
| [git](https://git-scm.com/)                                   | `^2`     | `git --version`       |
| [go](https://go.dev/)                                         | `^1.21`  | `go version`          |
| [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)                    | `^4`     | `make --version`      |

## Building the Taiko Client

First you're going to build `taiko-client`.

<Steps>

1. Clone the Taiko Alethia monorepo

    The [Taiko Alethia monorepo](https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-mono) contains the source code for the `taiko-client`.

    <Tabs>
        <TabItem label="Mac/Linux">
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-mono.git
        cd taiko-mono/packages/taiko-client
        ```
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="Windows">
        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-mono.git
        cd taiko-mono/packages/taiko-client && git config core.autocrlf false
        ```
        </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

2. Checkout the release branch you wish to run

    Release branches are created when new versions of the `taiko-client` are created.
    Find the branch you wish to check out in the [releases page](https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-mono/releases).

    Search by `taiko-client` to find all relevant releases.

    ```bash
    git checkout <release branch>
    ```

    <Aside>
    Make sure to read the releases page carefully to determine the correct branch to check out.
    Some may be specific to Taiko Hekla or Taiko Alethia.
    </Aside>

3. Build `taiko-client`

    ```bash
    make build
    ```

</Steps>

## Building the Execution Engine

Next you're going to build `taiko-geth`.

<Steps>

1. Clone taiko-geth

    The [`taiko-geth` repository](https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-geth) contains the source code for our execution engine.

    <Tabs>
      <TabItem label="Mac/Linux">
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-geth.git
        cd taiko-geth
        ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="Windows">
        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-geth.git
        cd taiko-geth && git config core.autocrlf false
        ```
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

2. Checkout the release branch you wish to run

    Release branches are created when new versions of the `taiko-geth` are created.
    Find the branch you wish to check out in the [releases page](https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-geth/releases).

    ```bash
    git checkout <release branch>
    ```

    <Aside>
    Make sure to read the releases page carefully to determine the correct branch to check out.
    Some may be specific to Taiko Hekla or Taiko Alethia.
    </Aside>

3. Build `taiko-geth`

    ```bash
    make geth
    ```

</Steps>

## What's Next?
    Now that you've built your own node from source, you can run it for Taiko Hekla or Taiko Alethia!
