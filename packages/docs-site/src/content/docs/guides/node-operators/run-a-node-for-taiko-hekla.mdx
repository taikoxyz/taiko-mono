This tutorial explains how to run a node for our testnet Taiko Hekla from source code.

## Building the Source Code

Please follow the [Building a Node from Source](/guides/node-operators/build-a-taiko-alethia-node-from-source) guide before continuing.
This guide presumes you have built the required images already (`taiko-geth` and `taiko-client`).

## Hardware Requirements

These are the recommended specs of a [mainnet Geth node](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/getting-started/hardware-requirements); the actual requirements may be lower.

*       16GB RAM
*       2TB SSD
*       Quad-core CPU

Node operators should plan for future storage needs as the requirements will grow continuously.

### Create a JWT Secret

`taiko-geth` and `taiko-client` communicate over the standard Ethereum engine API authrpc. This communication is secured using a shared secret.

You will need to generate a shared secret in the form of a 32 byte hex string.

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32 > jwt.txt
```

### Start `taiko-geth`

It's generally better to start `taiko-geth` before you start `taiko-client` as you will encounter less error messages.

`taiko-geth` can be started without `taiko-client` and will wait until `taiko-client` begins communicating.

<Steps>

1. Navigate to your `taiko-geth` directory

    Find the directory where you built the `taiko-geth` binary.

2. Copy the JWT secret you generated into the `taiko-geth` directory.

    ```bash
    cp /path/to/jwt.txt .
    ```

3. Start taiko-geth

    Use the following command to start `taiko-geth` in a default configuration.
    The JSON-RPC API will become available on port 28545.

    ```bash
        ./build/bin/geth \
            --taiko \
            --networkid 167009 \
            --gcmode archive \
            --datadir ./data/taiko-geth \
            --metrics \
            --metrics.expensive \
            --metrics.addr "0.0.0.0" \
            --bootnodes enode://2f7ee605f84362671e7d7c6d47b69a3358b0d87e9ba4648befcae8b19453275ed19059db347c459384c1a3e5486419233c06bf6c4c6f489d81ace6f301a2a446@43.153.55.134:30303,enode://c067356146268d2855ad356c1ce36ba9f78c1633a72f9b7f686679c2ffe04bab6d24e48ef6eefb0e01aa00dff5024f7f94bc583da90b6027f40be4129bbbc5fd@43.153.90.191:30303,enode://acc2bdb6416feddff9734bee1e6de91e684e9df5aeb1d36698cc78b920600aed36a2871e4ad0cf4521afcdc2cde8e2cd410a57038767c356d4ce6c69b9107a5a@170.106.109.12:30303,enode://eb5079aae185d5d8afa01bfd2d349da5b476609aced2b57c90142556cf0ee4a152bcdd724627a7de97adfc2a68af5742a8f58781366e6a857d4bde98de6fe986@34.66.210.65:30303,enode://2294f526cbb7faa778192289c252307420532191438ce821d3c50232e019a797bda8c8f8541de0847e953bb03096123856935e32294de9814d15d120131499ba@34.72.186.213:30303 \
            --authrpc.addr "0.0.0.0" \
            --authrpc.port 28551 \
            --authrpc.vhosts "*" \
            --authrpc.jwtsecret ./jwt.txt \
            --http \
            --http.api admin,debug,eth,net,web3,txpool,miner,taiko \
            --http.addr "0.0.0.0" \
            --http.port 28545 \
            --http.vhosts "*" \
            --ws \
            --ws.api admin,debug,eth,net,web3,txpool,miner,taiko \
            --ws.addr "0.0.0.0" \
            --ws.port 28546 \
            --ws.origins "*" \
            --gpo.ignoreprice "100000000" \
            --port 30304 \
            --syncmode full \
            --state.scheme=path
    ```
</Steps>

### Start `taiko-client`

This guide assumes you are running both `taiko-geth` and `taiko-client` on the same machine.

If you aren't, you can configure the ports and addresses so that the services can access each other.

<Steps>
1. Navigate to your `taiko-client` directory

    Find the directory where you built the `taiko-client` binary.

2. Copy the JWT secret

    <Aside>
    This should be the *same* JWT secret you used in the previous step for `taiko-geth`.
    </Aside>

    ```bash
    cp /path/to/jwt.txt .
    ```

3. Set environment variables

    The following URLs should be a Holesky node.

    You will need either an RPC provider, or run a full Holesky node yourself.

    ```bash
    export L1_WS=...  # the WS address for the node to sync from.
    export L1_BEACON_URL=... # URL address for the L1 Beacon-node HTTP endpoint to use.
    ```

4. Start taiko-client

    Use the following command to start `taiko-client` in a default configuration.

    You can find all other configurable flags by running `./bin/taiko-client driver`.

    This command assumes you've run the `taiko-geth` command as is, if you've changed ports please change them accordingly.

    <Aside type="tip">
    If you wish to enable a node without joining the preconfirmations p2p network, simply **remove all `p2p` and `preconfirmation` flags with the exception of `--p2p.sync` and `--p2p.checkPointSyncUrl`.**

    Please note that your node's chainhead will not be up-to-date with the preconfed blocks if you do not join the p2p network.
    </Aside>

    ```bash
        ./bin/taiko-client driver \
            --l1.ws ${L1_ENDPOINT_WS} \
            --l2.ws ws://l2_execution_engine:8546 \
            --l1.beacon ${L1_BEACON_HTTP} \
            --l2.auth http://l2_execution_engine:8551 \
            --taikoInbox 0x79C9109b764609df928d16fC4a91e9081F7e87DB \
            --taikoAnchor 0x1670090000000000000000000000000000010001 \
            --preconfirmation.whitelist 0x4aA38A15109eAbbf09b7967009A2e00D2D15cb84 \
            --preconfirmation.serverPort 9871 \
            --jwtSecret /data/taiko-geth/geth/jwtsecret \
            --p2p.sync \
            --p2p.checkPointSyncUrl https://rpc.hekla.taiko.xyz
            --p2p.bootnodes enode://ea5b8a797985f500afa37ba03ce47b0039792a942f0ac9bee9fa19a7a5410273fe43b4e8a9a28fa42cdec1b6435deb809fcb79479c55cc2ddbaf02de7a83f456@34.46.28.99:4001?discport=30304,enode://404e9493066107431bdf3f47bbb360a353244a6069903c76928fca3067575f2adf62ef396b0a8a74696669ef53cab8373e38ddd9b3d3d2d76f356d2cd2708951@34.30.143.124:4001?discport=30304,enode://b2d094ade1ce68990878b197bf818bd41d5b32e4019d42dc63d91d7020f531532f063833e44e84f78792969f69fd5553370216703c40fcc0cb835f17177fbe07@34.56.54.8:4001?discport=30304 \
            --p2p.listen.ip 0.0.0.0 \
            --p2p.useragent taiko \
            --p2p.listen.tcp 4001 \
            --p2p.advertise.tcp 4001 \
            --p2p.listen.udp 30303 \
            --p2p.advertise.tcp 30303 \
            --p2p.peerstore.path /node-keys/peerstore \
            --p2p.discovery.path /node-keys/discv5 \
            --p2p.advertise.ip ${YOUR_EXTERNAL_IP} \
            --p2p.priv.raw ${PRIVATE_KEY}
    ```
    <Aside type="danger">
    `YOUR_EXTERNAL_IP` should be **publicly accessible** from the internet, at the UDP and TCP ports you advertise from. If it is not, your node will not join the P2P network correctly.
    </Aside>

    If you do not wish to set an external IP manually, you may instead replace the `--p2p.listen.tcp` and all lines after in the above command with `--p2p.nat`. This will automate discovery, and you do not need to manually set ports.

    We **highly recommend** that you configure these manually.

    Your node also needs a private key set to acquire a stable peer ID. (`--p2p.priv.raw`) This private key should be unique to each node: if you are running multiple, please use different ones for each node. **This private key does not need to hold eth or any valuables, it is simply to persist an identity.**

    You may alternatively set `--p2p.priv.path`, which should be a path to a file that contains the hex-encoded 32-byte private key for the peer ID. We recommend using `--p2p.priv.raw` for simplicity.
</Steps>

<Aside>
  The method to find your external IP can differ depending on your setup. For a personal machine, `curl ifconfig.me` might suffice; if you are running your node through Kubernetes you will need to set a static IP for your LoadBalancer service as pod IPs change on recreation. If you run into issues doing this, please reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/984015101017346058/1117285651394600960)!
</Aside>

### Ensure that the relevant ports are open on your machine

  Whether you are running the node on a personal machine or a cloud provider's machine, you should ensure your the following ports on your machine are open and visible from the internet at your external IP:
    - TCP `4001` OR whichever port you set `--p2p.advertise.tcp` to.
    - UDP `30303` OR whichever port you set `--p2p.advertise.udp` to.

  These ports **are required for p2p gossiping preconfirmed blocks**, so if it is not set you will only subscribe to the events that are emitted on chain. You may need to add additional port-forwarding rules in your firewall/router to enable discovery from the internet.

### Ensure that your node has joined the P2P network

  To ensure that your node is actually configured correctly and has joined the P2P network for preconfirmations, please use `grep` to find logs regarding `peer tick`. You should find something that resembles the following:

  ```
  INFO [07-30|18:37:38.168] Peer tick                                peersLen=4 peers="[...]" addrInfo="[...]" id=... advertisedUDP=52700 advertisedTCP=4001 advertisedIP=...
  ```

  As long as `peersLen=X` is greater than or equal to 3, your node should have joined the P2P network correctly! If it is below that, please reach out to us on Discord for troubleshooting help.

### Syncing

Once you've started `taiko-geth` and `taiko-client` properly you should see them communicate with each other and start syncing.

Syncing can take several hours, depending on the size of the chain.
