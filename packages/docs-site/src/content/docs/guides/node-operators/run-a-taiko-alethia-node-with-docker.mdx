This guide will help you start up a Taiko Alethia RPC node using [simple-taiko-node](https://github.com/taikoxyz/simple-taiko-node).

## Software Dependencies

| Dependency                                                    | Version  | Version Check Command |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | --------------------- |
| [git](https://git-scm.com/)                                   | `^2`     | `git --version`       |
| [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)             | `^24.0`  | `docker --version`    |

## Prerequisites

- If using Windows, you should install [Git BASH](https://gitforwindows.org/) or [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to use as your terminal.
- Meet the [Geth minimum hardware requirements](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum#hardware-requirements) except for the storage requirement because Taiko nodes will require less storage (at the time of writing).

## Run a Taiko Alethia node with simple-taiko-node

<Steps>

1. Clone simple-taiko-node

    <Tabs>
      <TabItem label="Mac/Linux">
        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/taikoxyz/simple-taiko-node.git
        cd simple-taiko-node
        ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="Windows">
        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/taikoxyz/simple-taiko-node.git
        cd simple-taiko-node && git config core.autocrlf false
        ```
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

2. Copy the sample .env files

    <Aside title="Info">
    To run a `Taiko Hekla` node please copy `.env.sample.hekla` instead of `.env.sample`.
    </Aside>

    ```sh
    cp .env.sample .env
    ```

3. Set the L1 node endpoint

    First, open the `.env` in your preferred text editor:

    <Tabs>
      <TabItem label="Mac/Linux">
        ```sh
        nano .env
        ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="Windows">
        ```sh
        notepad .env
        ```
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    <Aside>
    You can use any L1 endpoint to run a Taiko L1 node unless you want to prove blocks past the last 128 blocks, in which case you will need an archive node.

    It's recommended to [run a local L1 node](/guides/node-operators/run-an-ethereum-testnet-node) but you browse around for other RPC Providers. Keep in mind they will **eventually rate limit your node** and it will stop syncing, so a local L1 node is recommended for a proper setup.

    For Taiko Alethia, the L1 Node will need to be an Ethereum node; for Taiko Hekla, the L1 Node will need to be an Ethereum testnet (Holesky) node.
    </Aside>

    Next, you will set the L1 node endpoints. If you are running a local L1 node, you cannot reference the L1 endpoints as `ws://127.0.0.1:8546` and `http://127.0.0.1:5052` because that is local to inside the simple-taiko-node Docker networking. Instead you can try:

    - Using `host.docker.internal` (see: [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24319662)).
    - Using the private ip address of your machine (use something like `ip addr show` to get this ip address).

    After getting the address of the L1 node, set the following L1 node endpoints in your `.env` file. Here is an example:

    - `L1_ENDPOINT_WS=ws://192.168.1.15:8546`
    - `L1_BEACON_HTTP=http://192.168.1.15:5052`

4. Remove old testnet volumes

    If you ran a testnet node previously, make sure to first remove the old volumes:

    ```sh
    docker compose down -v
    ```

5. Set the profiles you want to run

    In your `.env`, please set `COMPOSE_PROFILES` to whichever set of services you'd like to run in a comma separated list (i.e., `l2_execution_engine,prover` or any combination of the three).

    Note that if you include `prover`, the service will still be disabled if you do not set `ENABLE_PROVER=true` in your `.env` file.

    <Aside type="tip">
    The following steps 6-8 are only necessary if you wish to have your node receive preconfirmed blocks and keep up with the tip of the chain.

    **To enable preconfs in your node**, please ensure that `ENABLE_PRECONFS_P2P` is set to `true` in your `.env` file.

    If it is set to `false`, your node **will not receive preconfed blocks** and only update it's chainhead when the events are emitted on-chain.
    </Aside>

6. Set your node's external IP for p2p discovery

    This is an important config for based preconfirmations. Find your machine's external IP and set `PUBLIC_IP={EXTERNAL_IP}` in your `.env` file. You may choose to leave it blank, in which case our scripts will enable `p2p.nat` in your driver; this means that you will automatically enable NAT traversal with PMP/UPNP devices to learn external IP. This is not preferred, and we highly recommend you manually set the `PUBLIC_IP` for discovery.

    <Aside type="danger">
    `YOUR_EXTERNAL_IP` should be **publicly accessible** from the internet, at the UDP and TCP ports you advertise from. If it is not, your node will not join the P2P network correctly.
    </Aside>

7. Ensure that the relevant ports are open on your machine **at the external IP you set.**

    Whether you are running the node on a personal machine or a cloud provider's machine, you should ensure your the following ports on your machine are **open and visible to the internet at your external IP:**
      - TCP `4001` OR whichever port you set `P2P_TCP_PORT` to in your `.env`.
      - UDP `30303` OR whichever port you set `P2P_UDP_PORT` to in your `.env`.

    These ports **are required for p2p gossiping preconfirmed blocks**, so if it is not set you will only subscribe to the events that are emitted on chain. You may need to add additional port-forwarding rules in your firewall/router to enable discovery from the internet.

8. Set a private key for your P2P id

    Another important config for based preconfirmations, your node needs a private key set to acquire a stable peer ID. This private key should be unique to each node: if you are running multiple, please use different ones for each node. **This private key does not need to hold eth or any valuables, it is simply to persist an identity.**

    You may either set `PRIV_RAW` in your `.env`, or `PRIV_FILE`:
      - `PRIV_RAW` is the hexstring private key in plaintext
      - `PRIV_FILE` is the name of your txt file that consists entirely of a private key with no newlines IN YOUR `/script/` DIRECTORY.

9. Start the node

    <Aside title="Info">
    Make sure Docker is running and then run the following command to start the node (you may need to use `sudo docker compose up -d` if your user is not in the `docker` group):

    To run a Taiko Hekla node please use the following command instead: `docker compose -f docker-compose-hekla.yml up -d`.
    </Aside>

    ```sh
    docker compose up -d
    ```

10. Verify that your node has joined the P2P network

    To ensure that your node is actually configured correctly and has joined the P2P network for preconfirmations, please use `grep` to find logs regarding `peer tick`. You should find something that resembles the following:

    ```
    INFO [07-30|18:37:38.168] Peer tick                                peersLen=6 peers="[...]" addrInfo="[...]" id=... advertisedUDP=52700 advertisedTCP=4001 advertisedIP=...
    ```

    As long as `connected=X` is greater than or equal to 6, your node should have joined the P2P network correctly! If it is below that, please reach out to us on Discord for troubleshooting help.

11. Verify node is running

    #### Option 1: Check with the node dashboard

    A node dashboard will be running on `localhost` on the `GRAFANA_PORT` you set in your `.env` file, which defaults to `3001`: [http://localhost:3001/d/L2ExecutionEngine/l2-execution-engine-overview](http://localhost:3001/d/L2ExecutionEngine/l2-execution-engine-overview).

    You can verify that your node is syncing by checking that the **chain head** on the dashboard is increasing. Once the chain head matches what's on the block explorer, you are fully synced.

    #### Option 2: Check with curl commands

    <Steps>
    1. Check if the Execution Layer client is connected to Taiko L2:

        ```bash
        curl http://localhost:8547 \
          -X POST \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          --data '{"method":"eth_chainId","params":[],"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}'
        ```

        which should return the chainId as `0x28c61` (167009):

        ```json
        { "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "result": "0x28c61" }
        ```

    2. Check if the Execution Layer client is synced by requesting the latest Taiko L2 / L3 block from the Execution Layer client:

        ```bash
        curl http://localhost:8547 \
          -X POST \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          --data '{"method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}'
        ```

    3. If the blockNumber response value is `0` or not growing, check the Taiko L2 logs here:

        ```bash
        docker compose logs -f
        ```

        > Note: You may need to use `sudo docker compose logs -f` if you are not in the `docker` group.
    </Steps>
</Steps>
