This guide will help you get a Hoodi archive node up and running.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) is installed and **running**.
- [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git/) is installed.
- If using Windows, you should install [Git BASH](https://gitforwindows.org/) or [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to use as your terminal.

## Steps



<Steps>

1. Clone eth-docker

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ethstaker/eth-docker
    cd eth-docker
    ```
    <Aside>
    As the Holesky testnet is in the process of sunsetting, `eth-docker`'s latest version does not have support for setting up a Holesky node.
    If you still wish to run a Holesky node, you may do so by checking out an older release with the following command: `git checkout v2.15.0.0`
    </Aside>

2. Do the eth-docker quickstart config

    Complete the [eth-docker quickstart](https://eth-docker.net/Usage/QuickStart/). You will need to run the config command:

    ```bash
    ./ethd config
    ```
    Select the Hoodi testnet and follow the quickstart guide.
    Make sure to enable Grafana dashboards.

3. Expose RPC ports

    To expose the node's RPC and REST ports (for a Taiko node to make calls to it), you can append `el-shared.yml` and `cl-shared.yml` to the list of files in the `COMPOSE_FILE` variable in your `.env` file:

    ```txt "el-shared.yml" "cl-shared.yml"
    COMPOSE_FILE=lighthouse-cl-only.yml:geth.yml:el-shared.yml:cl-shared.yml
    ```

    Keep in mind this is **not encrypted**, so you should not expose it to the internet. eth-docker offers a few other options that you can read about [here](https://ethdocker.com/Usage/Advanced/SharedPorts/#sharing-rpc-and-rest-ports).

4. Start Docker containers

    ```bash
    ./ethd up
    ```

5. Check your node is running properly

    You can visit the [Grafana dashboard](https://eth-docker.net/Usage/Dashboards/#connecting-to-local-grafana) which should be running on `localhost:3000` to verify if your node is running correctly. You should see the chain head increasing.

See [Run a Sepolia L1 archive node (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Lg_cY7iP2o), the only difference is you need to select **Hoodi testnet**.
