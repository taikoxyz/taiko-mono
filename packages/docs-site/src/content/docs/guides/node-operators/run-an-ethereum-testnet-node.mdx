This guide will help you get a Hoodi archive node up and running.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) is installed and **running**.
- [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git/) is installed.
- If using Windows, you should install [Git BASH](https://gitforwindows.org/) or [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to use as your terminal.

## Steps

<Steps>

1.  Clone eth-docker

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ethstaker/eth-docker
    cd eth-docker
    ```

2.  Do the eth-docker quickstart config

    Complete the [eth-docker quickstart](https://eth-docker.net/Usage/QuickStart/). You will need to run the config command:

    ```bash
    ./ethd config
    ```

    Select the Hoodi testnet and follow the quickstart guide.
    Make sure to enable Grafana dashboards.

3.  Expose RPC ports

    To expose the node's RPC and REST ports (for a Taiko node to make calls to it), you can append `el-shared.yml` and `cl-shared.yml` to the list of files in the `COMPOSE_FILE` variable in your `.env` file:

    ```txt "el-shared.yml" "cl-shared.yml"
    COMPOSE_FILE=lighthouse-cl-only.yml:geth.yml:el-shared.yml:cl-shared.yml
    ```

    Keep in mind this is **not encrypted**, so you should not expose it to the internet. eth-docker offers a few other options that you can read about [here](https://ethdocker.com/Usage/Advanced/SharedPorts/#sharing-rpc-and-rest-ports).

4.  Start Docker containers

          <Aside type="tip">

    As of October 28, 2025, at slot 1,622,016, the Fusaka upgrade has rolled out to Ethereum Hoodi. With this upgrade comes [EIP-7594](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-7594.md),
    which introduces data sampling instead of full downloads; this means that if you are not running an Ethereum Hoodi semi-supernode or supernode beacon client,
    you L2 node may experience blob unavailability or chain divergence.

    Please configure your beacon client with the respective flags (detailed below) before the Fusaka hard fork date to avoid interruptions!
    - Lighthouse: **`--semi-supernode` or `--supernode`**
    - Teku: **`--p2p-subscribe-all-custody-subnets-enabled`**
    - Grandine: **`--subscribe-all-data-column-subnets`**
    - Lodestar: **`--supernode`**
    - Nimbus: **`--debug-peerdas-supernode`**

    This can be done by searching for the respective `{beacon_client_name}.yml` file in `eth-docker` and adding the above listed flags under the `entrypoint` field before starting the docker containers.

          </Aside>

    ```bash
    ./ethd up
    ```

5.  Check your node is running properly

    You can visit the [Grafana dashboard](https://eth-docker.net/Usage/Dashboards/#connecting-to-local-grafana) which should be running on `localhost:3000` to verify if your node is running correctly. You should see the chain head increasing.

See [Run a Sepolia L1 archive node (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Lg_cY7iP2o), the only difference is you need to select **Hoodi testnet**.
