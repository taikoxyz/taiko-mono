## **Bonding Mechanisms in Taiko Alethia**

Bonding is a fundamental mechanism in the **proving and verification process** of Taiko Alethia. Bonds ensure that **provers remain accountable** for their commitments.

### **Liveness Bond**

- A bond posted by the **initially assigned block prover** to guarantee that they will **submit the first proof** within the required proving window.
- **Purpose**: Ensures that the assigned prover remains active and submits the initial proof within the allocated time.
- **Lifecycle**:
  1. The **L2 block proposer** submits a block via `proposeBlock` on **Ethereum L1**.
  2. The assigned prover locks a **Liveness Bond** to signal commitment.
  3. If the prover submits the proof within the **proving window**, the bond is refunded.
  4. If the proof is not submitted within the proving window, **another prover can step in**.

## **Key Takeaways**

1. **Liveness Bond** ensures that the initial prover submits their proof on time.
