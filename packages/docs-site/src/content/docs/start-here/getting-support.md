### Diving deeper into Taiko Alethia

There are two main places to look for Taiko Alethia's documentation. The user docs which are here, and the developer docs / source code comments inside of our protocol monorepo, [taiko-mono](https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-mono).

In the future, Taiko Gwyneth documentation will also be hosted here!
