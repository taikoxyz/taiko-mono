        Remove all soft blocks from the blockchain beyond the specified block height,
        ensuring the latest block ID does not exceed the given height. This method will fail if
        the block with an ID one greater than the specified height is not a soft block. If the
        specified block height is greater than the latest soft block ID, the method will succeed
        without modifying the blockchain.

        Insert a group of transactions into a soft block for preconfirmation. If the group is the
        first for a block, a new soft block will be created. Otherwise, the transactions will
        be appended to the existing soft block. The API will fail if:
        1) the block is not soft
        2) block-level parameters are invalid or do not match the current soft block’s parameters
        3) the group ID is not exactly 1 greater than the previous one
        4) the last group of the block indicates no further transactions are allowed
