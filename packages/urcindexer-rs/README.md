# URC Indexer

The URC indexer is a thin wrapper around Nethermind's `urc` crate that continuously indexes the Ultra Rollup Committee (URC) registry from L1 and persists the state in MySQL. It runs the `RegistryMonitor::run_indexing_loop`, ensuring all `OperatorRegistered` and `OperatorOptedIn` events are stored so that other services can reconstruct the URC lookahead set efficiently.

## What it does

- Connects to the L1 RPC defined by `L1_RPC_URL` and the on-chain `REGISTRY_ADDRESS`.
- Streams registry events starting at `L1_START_BLOCK`, respecting fork depth and batching tuned by environment variables.
- Persists operators, signed registrations, protocols, and sync metadata using a MySQL database referenced via `DATABASE_URL`.
- Exposes the indexed state through MySQL for downstream services that need to query URC membership or construct lookahead windows.

## Configuration

All runtime configuration is provided via environment variables:

- `DATABASE_URL` (required): MySQL connection string.
- `L1_RPC_URL`: HTTP endpoint for the L1 node.
- `REGISTRY_ADDRESS`: Registry contract address.
- `L1_START_BLOCK`: First block to index (default `1`).
- `MAX_L1_FORK_DEPTH`: Safety buffer when selecting canonical blocks (default `2`).
- `INDEX_BLOCK_BATCH_SIZE`: Maximum number of blocks indexed per batch when catching up (default `25`).
- `RUST_LOG`: Logging level (default `info`).

## Running locally

```bash
# Start MySQL (listens on 127.0.0.1:3307 by default)
make db-up

# Run the indexer against your configured environment variables
make run
```

## Docker usage

```bash
# Build and start the indexer together with MySQL
DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64 docker compose --profile app up --build
```

The indexer container runs as soon as the MySQL health check succeeds and will emit logs to stdout. Downstream services can connect to the MySQL container at `mysql://urcindexer:password@mysql:3306/urcindexer`.

## Intended consumers

This binary does not expose an API. Instead, other Taiko services should depend on the populated MySQL tables to reconstruct URC lookahead information or other committee queries. The schema mirrors the upstream `urc` crate tables and remains compatible with existing consumers in the monorepo.
