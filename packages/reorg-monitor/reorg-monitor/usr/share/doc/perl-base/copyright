 cpan/Compress-Raw-Bzip2/bzip2-src/README states:
  Note that the files bzip2.c, bzip2recover.c, bzlib.c & decompress.c
  have been modified to allow them to build with a C++ compiler.
  The file bzip2-src/bzip2-cpp.patch contains the patch
  that was used to modify the original source.
 but the patch has apparently been filtered out when including the software
 into the Perl core distribution.

Comment:
 This directory is a snapshot of the upstream metaconfig repository,
 containing code originally forked from 'dist' upstream by Larry
 Wall and Raphael Manfredi. The 'dist/' subdirectory is unmodified
 upstream code, but the other subdirectories contain mixed code.
 Some units are dual licensed and some are specifically Artistic-only.
 .
 The bin/ subdirectory is being filtered from the upstream snapshot
 (with the Files-Excluded mechanism at the top of this copyright file)
 because it contains files generated from dist sources. The Debian
 package build uses the tools from the separate 'dist' package.
 .
 From regen-configure/U/README:
 .
 You may distribute the files contained in this distribution
 under the terms of either
 .
    a) the "Artistic License" which comes with Perl, or
 .
    b) the "Artistic License" which comes with dist, or

    c) the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
    Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option) any
    later version (see the file "Copying" that comes with the
    Perl distribution).
 .
 The full text of the "Artistic License" which comes with dist
 differs slightly from the one that is in /usr/share/common-licenses
 on Debian systems, and can be found later in this file under the
 "Artistic-dist" tag.

Comment:
 From regen-configure/U/README:
 .
  The units in the "modified" directory have been derived from units
  associated with the metaconfig program of Raphael Manfredi's "dist"
  distribution.  These units list Raphael Manfredi as the Copyright holder.
  dist is distributed under a modified version of the Perl Artistic License.
  Clause 7 of this modified license as contained in dist-3.0-pl60 provides:
 .
    7. You may reuse parts of this Package in your own programs, provided
    that you explicitly state where you got them from, in the source code
    (and, left to your courtesy, in the documentation), duplicating
    all the associated copyright notices and disclaimers. Besides
    your changes, if any, must be clearly marked as such. Parts reused
    that way will no longer fall under this license if, and only if,
    the name of your program(s) have no immediate connection with the
    name of the Package itself or its associated programs.  You may then
    apply whatever restrictions you wish on the reused parts or choose
    to place them in the Public Domain--this will apply only within the
    context of your package.
 .
  In accordance with this clause, the versions of these units
  contained here are made available under the same terms as the
  rest of the units.
 .
 It is assumed that the above relicensing also applies to all files in
 the other subdirectories that are declared to be licensed under the
 same modified Artistic license.
 .
 The modified license can be found later in this file under the
 "Artistic-dist" tag.

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
 license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
 Preamble
 .
 This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
 Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.
 The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic
 control over the development of that Package while still keeping the
 Package available as open source and free software.
 .
 You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
 license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the
 terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
 make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
 a different licensing arrangement.
 .
 Definitions
 .
 "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in
 the copyright notice for the entire Package.
 .
 "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other
 material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's
 procedures.
 .
 "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy, distribute,
 or modify the Package.
 .
 "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright
 Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A
 given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a
 Modified Version.
 .
 "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
 accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or
 organization, to others outside of your company or organization.
 .
 "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this
 Package or providing support for this Package to another party. It
 does not mean licensing fees.
 .
 "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been modified,
 or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the
 Copyright Holder.
 .
 "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such
 changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.
 .
 "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the
 Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may
 be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.
 .
 "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
 configuration files for the Package.
 .
 "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or
 any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation
 of the Source form.
 .
 Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution
 .
 (1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
 Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that
 you do not Distribute the Modified Version.
 .
 Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version
 .
 (2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
 Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
 either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate
 all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At
 your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a
 Compiled form of the Package.
 .
 (3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
 modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting
 Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such
 will be subject to the Original License.
 .
 Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source
 .
 (4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis
 or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
 Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs
 from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting
 any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that
 you do at least ONE of the following:
 .
 (a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the
 Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright
 Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version. (b)
 ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the
 user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the
 Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of
 the Standard Version. (c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the
 Modified Version to make the Source form of the Modified Version
 available to others under (i) the Original License or (ii) a license
 that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and redistribute the
 Modified Version using the same licensing terms that apply to the copy
 that the licensee received, and requires that the Source form of the
 Modified Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
 available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are
 allowed.
 .
 Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified
 Versions without the Source
 .
 (5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
 the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
 get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be
 valid at the time of your distribution. If these instructions, at any
 time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you
 must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.
 If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty
 days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then
 you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.
 .
 (6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the
 Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the
 Source of the Modified Version.
 .
 Aggregating or Linking the Package
 .
 (7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
 Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
 aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
 Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
 components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
 apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
 as included in the aggregation.
 .
 (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with
 other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to
 build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that
 include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,
 provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.
 .
 Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version
 .
 (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
 merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
 the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not
 considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the
 terms of this license.
 .
 General Provisions
 .
 (10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or
 Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,
 modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not
 use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this
 license.
 .
 (11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version
 made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to
 ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of
 this license.
 .
 (12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
 service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.
 .
 (13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,
 free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
 sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any
 patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily
 infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation
 (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging
 that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent
 infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the
 date that such litigation is filed.
 .
 (14) Disclaimer of Warranty: THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT
 HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
 WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
 PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT

License:  CC0-1.0
 Statatement of Purpose
 .
 The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
 exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
 and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work
 of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
 .
 Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work
 for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
 scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without
 fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in
 other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form
 whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial
 purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal
 of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and
 scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for
 their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.
 .
 For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
 expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
 associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that
 he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work,
 voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute
 the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and
 Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect
 of CC0 on those rights.
 .
 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
 protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright
 and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are
 not limited to, the following:
 .
    the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
    communicate, and translate a Work;
 .
    moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
 .
    publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
    likeness depicted in a Work;
 .
    rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
    subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
 .
    rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;
 .
    database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC
    of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996
    on the legal protection of databases, and under any national
    implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version
    of such directive); and
 .
    other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
    based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations
    thereof.
 .
 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
 of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
 irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all
 of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and
 causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing
 as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in
 all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by
 applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
 in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv)
 for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
 advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the
 Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
 detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such
 Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
 termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the
 quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's
 express Statement of Purpose.
 .
 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any
 reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law,
 then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted
 taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In
 addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby
 grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non
 sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license
 to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i)
 in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided
 by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
 in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv)
 for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
 advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall
 be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the
 Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
 invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity
 or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License,
 and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i)
 exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in
 the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action
 with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express
 Statement of Purpose.
 .
 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
 .
    No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived,
    abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this
    document.
 .
    Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties
    of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy,
    or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable,
    all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
 .
    Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other
    persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including
    without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the
    Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any
    necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any
    use of the Work.
 .
    Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not
    a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect
    to this CC0 or use of the Work.

License: RRA-KEEP-THIS-NOTICE
 Copying and distribution of this file, with or without modification, are
 permitted in any medium without royalty provided the copyright notice and
 this notice are preserved.  This file is offered as-is, without any
 warranty.

License: Artistic-dist
                       The "Artistic License"
 .
                              Preamble
 .
 The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
 Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
 semblance of artistic control over the development of the Package,
 while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
 the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
 reasonable modifications.
 .
 It also grants you the rights to reuse parts of a Package in your own
 programs without transferring this License to those programs, provided
 that you meet some reasonable requirements.
 .
 Definitions:
 .
         "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
         Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
         created through textual modification.
 .
         "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
         modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes
         of the Copyright Holder as specified below.
 .
         "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or
         copyrights for the package.
 .
         "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing
         this Package.
 .
         "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the
         basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,
         and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the
         Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large
         as a market that must bear the fee.)
 .
         "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item
         itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.
         It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it
         under the same conditions they received it.
 .
 1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
 Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
 duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.
 .
 2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
 derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package
 modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.
 .
 3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided
 that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and
 when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the
 following:
 .
     a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
     Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or
     an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive
     site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include
     your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.
 .
     b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.
 .
     c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
     with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide
     a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
     documents how it differs from the Standard Version.
 .
     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
 .
 4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
 executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
 .
     a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
     together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
     to get the Standard Version.
 .
     b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
     the Package with your modifications.
 .
     c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly
     document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together
     with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.
 .
     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
 .
 5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
 Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
 Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,
 you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
 commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software
 distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a
 product of your own.
 .
 6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
 output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
 under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated
 them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
 Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this
 Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a
 binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall
 neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it
 fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do
 not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this
 Package.
 .
 7. You may reuse parts of this Package in your own programs, provided that
 you explicitly state where you got them from, in the source code (and, left
 to your courtesy, in the documentation), duplicating all the associated
 copyright notices and disclaimers. Besides your changes, if any, must be
 clearly marked as such. Parts reused that way will no longer fall under this
 license if, and only if, the name of your program(s) have no immediate
 connection with the name of the Package itself or its associated programs.
 You may then apply whatever restrictions you wish on the reused parts or
 choose to place them in the Public Domain--this will apply only within the
 context of your package.
 .
 8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
 products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.
 .
 9. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR
 IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED
 WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
