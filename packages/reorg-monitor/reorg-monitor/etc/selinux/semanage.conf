# Specify how libsemanage will interact with a SELinux policy manager.
# The four options are:
#
#  "source"     - libsemanage manipulates a source SELinux policy
#  "direct"     - libsemanage will write directly to a module store.
#  /foo/bar     - Write by way of a policy management server, whose
#                 named socket is at /foo/bar.  The path must begin
#                 with a '/'.
#  example.com:4242
#               - Establish a TCP connection to a remote policy
#                 management server at example.com.  If there is a colon
#                 then the remainder is interpreted as a port number;
#                 otherwise default to port 4242.
module-store = direct

# When generating the final linked and expanded policy, by default
# semanage will set the policy version to POLICYDB_VERSION_MAX, as
# given in <sepol/policydb.h>.  Change this setting if a different
# version is necessary.
#policy-version = 19

# expand-check check neverallow rules when executing all semanage commands.
# Large penalty in time if you turn this on.
expand-check=0

# By default, semanage will generate policies for the SELinux target.
# To build policies for Xen, uncomment the following line.
#target-platform = xen
