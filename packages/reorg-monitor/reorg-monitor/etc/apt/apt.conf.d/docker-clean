# Since for most Docker users, package installs happen in "docker build" steps,
# they essentially become individual layers due to the way Docker handles
# layering, especially using CoW filesystems.  What this means for us is that
# the caches that APT keeps end up just wasting space in those layers, making
# our layers unnecessarily large (especially since we'll normally never use
# these caches again and will instead just "docker build" again and make a brand
# new image).

# Ideally, these would just be invoking "apt-get clean", but in our testing,
# that ended up being cyclic and we got stuck on APT's lock, so we get this fun
# creation that's essentially just "apt-get clean".
