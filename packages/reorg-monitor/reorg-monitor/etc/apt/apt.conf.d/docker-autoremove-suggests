# Since Docker users are looking for the smallest possible final images, the
# following emerges as a very common pattern:

#   RUN apt-get update \
#       && apt-get install -y <packages> \
#       && <do some compilation work> \
#       && apt-get purge -y --auto-remove <packages>

# By default, APT will actually _keep_ packages installed via Recommends or
# Depends if another package Suggests them, even and including if the package
# that originally caused them to be installed is removed.  Setting this to
# "false" ensures that APT is appropriately aggressive about removing the
# packages it added.
