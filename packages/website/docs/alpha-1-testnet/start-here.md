# 👋 Start here

Welcome to Taiko's Alpha-1 testnet, **Snæfellsjökull**. There are two networks involved in the testnet, which we'll define:

- **Taiko A1** is the Alpha-1 testnet release of Taiko — a fully decentralized, Ethereum-equivalent ZK-Rollup.
- **Ethereum A1** is Taiko's privately deployed Ethereum network, which serves as the L1 for Taiko's Alpha-1 testnet.

## What can I do?

In this testnet, you can:

- 🌉 Bridge tokens between Ethereum A1 and Taiko A1.
- 🤝 Send transactions (e.g., deploy contracts).
- 🌐 Run a node — this makes _you_ a part of Taiko!
- 📝 Submit feedback and be forever loved.
- 🥇 Earn a POAP by using your wallet to complete any 2 of the 3 following actions by January 31st 23:59 UTC:
  - Use the bridge
  - Contract interaction (e.g., interact w/ dapp, deploy a contract)
  - Transfer between accounts

Once you are finished testing the network, please submit the feedback log to help improve Taiko!
