First, here is a flowchart of how our bridge dapp implementation works, which uses the signal service:

## How does Ether bridging work?

Taiko's bridge utilizes the Signal Service we described. Here is the general user flow for Taiko's bridge:

1. The user sends their funds to the Bridge contract
2. The Bridge locks the Ether, and stores a message by calling `sendSignal(message)` on the SignalService contract
3. The user receives Ether on the destination chain, if they (or another) provide a valid merkle proof that the message was received on the source chain

## How does ERC-20 bridging work?

ERC-20 tokens originate from a canonical chain. To send a token and bridge it to the other chain, a new BridgedERC20 contract needs to be deployed on the destination chain.

### Bridge from canonical chain to destination chain

Here are the overall steps for transferring canonical ERC-20 from a source chain to the destination chain:

1. A contract for the ERC-20 must first be deployed on the destination chain (will be done automatically by the TokenVault if not already deployed)

2. Call sendERC20 on the source chain TokenVault, this will **transfer** the amount by using the `safeTransferFrom` function on the canonical ERC-20 contract, on the source chain, to the TokenVault.

3. Send a message to the Signal Service (on the source chain), this message will contain some metadata related to the bridge request, but most importantly it includes the calldata for the `receiveERC20` method.

4. Process the message on the destination chain by submitting a merkle proof (generated from the source chain), proving that a message is included in the state of the source chain Signal Service. After verifying this occurred and doing some checks, it will attempt to invoke the `receiveERC20` method encoded in the message. This will **mint** ERC-20 on the BridgedERC20 contract to the `to` address on the destination chain!

### Bridge from destination chain back to the canonical chain

Okay now let's do the reverse, how do we transfer a bridged token from a source chain to the destination chain?

1. A contract for the ERC-20 already exists on the canonical chain, so no need to deploy a new one.
2. Call sendERC20 on the source chain TokenVault, this will **burn** the ERC-20 on the BridgedERC20 contract.
3. Send a message to the Signal Service (on the source chain), this message will contain some metadata related to the bridge request, but most importantly it includes the calldata for the `receiveERC20` method.
4. Process the message on the destination chain by submitting a merkle proof (generated from the source chain), proving that a message is included in the state of the source chain Signal Service. After verifying this occurred and doing some checks, it will attempt to invoke the `receiveERC20` method encoded in this message. This will **transfer** the amount from the destination chain TokenVault to the `to` address on the destination chain.
