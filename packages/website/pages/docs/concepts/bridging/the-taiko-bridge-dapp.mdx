The bridge is a set of smart contracts and a frontend web app that allow you to send testnet ETH and ERC-20 tokens between Sepolia and Taiko. This bridge is just one possible implementation built on top of Taiko's core protocol, specifically the signal service which anybody can use to build bridges. You can try the bridge [here](https://bridge.internal.taiko.xyz).
