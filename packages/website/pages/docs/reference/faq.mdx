## What is Taiko?

Taiko is a fully permissionless and decentralized Ethereum-equivalent ZK-Rollup. This means using Taiko is exactly the same as using Ethereum. Not only does Taiko support all EVM opcodes, but it supports the full JSON-RPC execution client API.

Taiko is an L2 that derives it's security from Ethereum. There is no centralized sequencer or provers, all operations are permissionless and community driven. Read more about Taiko under our [concepts section](/docs/concepts/overview).

## Does Taiko have a roadmap?

You can find the Taiko roadmap [here](/images/roadmaps/taiko-roadmap.png).

## What is a Type 1 ZK-EVM?

The different types of ZK-EVMs make tradeoffs between compatibility and proof generation cost. A Type 1 ZK-EVM prioritizes compatibility over proof generation cost.

Another term for Type 1 ZK-EVMs is “Ethereum-equivalent”. This term comes from the fact that Type 1 ZK-EVMs make no changes to the Ethereum architecture, whether it be the hash function, state trees, or gas costs. This equivalency allows us to reuse execution clients with minimal modification.

## Is Taiko open source?

Yes, Taiko is open source under the permissive MIT license (free to access and modify). The Geth fork ([taiko-geth](https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-geth)) retains the original Geth GPL licenses.

## Can I ignore these logs from my node?

See [node troubleshooting](/docs/reference/node-troubleshooting) for a list of node logs that can be ignored and which are errors.

## Where can I find the deployed contract addresses?

See [contract addresses](/docs/reference/contract-addresses) for a list of deployed contract addresses.

## I ran a node during a previous testnet do I need to do anything different

Your Sepolia archive node should be fine. For your Taiko node, you should remove the node (see the [node runner manual](/docs/manuals/node-runner-manual)) and directory, and then follow the [Taiko node running guide](/docs/guides/run-a-taiko-node) again.

## Does Taiko have a sequencer?

Taiko does not have an L2 sequencer, since everyone can become a proposer permissionlessly.
Ultimately the L1 Ethereum validator for the current block is the sequencer that can sequence multiple L2 blocks.
