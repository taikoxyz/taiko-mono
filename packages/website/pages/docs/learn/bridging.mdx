# Bridging

Let's explain bridging on Taiko. We will go over the following topics:

- What is bridging and why is it important?
- How does the Taiko protocol enable secure cross-chain messaging?
- What is Taiko's Signal Service?
- A flowchart of bridging for the visual learners
- How does Ether bridging work?
- How does ERC-20 bridging work?

## What is bridging and why is it important?

Bridges are foundational for cross-chain users and applications. Users might come to another chain, such as Taiko (a ZK-rollup). To do this, they need to bridge over funds. Notoriously, bridging has been a dangerous operation. How do you make sure that this bridge is secure?

## How does the Taiko protocol enable secure cross-chain messaging?

### Taiko stores block hashes of each chain

Taiko deploys two smart contracts which store the hashes of the other chain:

- TaikoL1 stores a blockNumber->blockHash mapping `l2Hashes` (deployed on Ethereum)
- TaikoL2 stores a blockNumber->blockHash mapping `l1Hashes` (deployed on Taiko)

Every time an L2 block is created on Taiko, the hash of the enclosing block on L1 is stored in the TaikoL2 contract. And every time an L1 block is verified, the L2 hash is stored in the TaikoL1 contract (only the latest one, if multiple ones are verified at once).

### Merkle trees enable verifying values exist on the other chain

Merkle trees are a data storage structure that allows a lot of data to be fingerprinted with a single hash, called the root hash. The way that they are structured enables one to verify that some value exists within this large data structure, without actually needing to have access to the entire merkle tree. To do this, the verifier would need:

- The root hash, this represents the root of the merkle tree
- The value, this is the value we are checking is inside the root hash
- A list of intermediate sibling hashes, these are the hashes that enable the verifier to re-calculate the root hash

A verifier will take the value, which is a leaf in the merkle tree, and using the sibling hashes will recalculate the merkle root. A simple way to think of this is that it checks if the calculated root hash matches the one we were provided. If it does, it means we have proved that this exists in the root hash.

If we assume that each chain correctly maintains the latest hashes of the other chain, we can verify on one chain that a message was sent on the other chain.

## What is Taiko's Signal Service?

Taiko's signal service is a smart contract available on both L1 and L2, available for any dapp developer to use. It exposes a [really simple interface](/docs/reference/contract-documentation/signal/ISignalService). And it's what uses the previously mentioned merkle proofs to provide a service for secure cross-chain messaging.

You can store signals and check if a signal was sent from an address. It also exposes one more important function: `isSignalReceived`.

What does this function do? The first thing to understand is that the Taiko protocol maintains two important contracts:

- [TaikoL1](/docs/reference/contract-documentation/L1/TaikoL1)
- [TaikoL2](/docs/reference/contract-documentation/L2/TaikoL2)

These contracts both keep track of the block hashes on the **other chain**. So TaikoL1, which is deployed on Ethereum, has access to the latest block hashes on Taiko. And TaikoL2, which is deployed on Taiko, has access to the latest block hashes on Ethereum.

So, `isSignalReceived` can prove on either chain that you sent a signal to the Signal Service on the other chain. A user or dapp can call `eth_getProof`(https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1186) which generates a merkle proof.

You need to provide `eth_getProof` with:

1. The signal (the data you want to prove exists within the storage root of some block on the chain)
2. The address of the signal service (the contract address which stores the provided signal)
3. The block number you are asserting the signal was sent on (optional—if you don't provide this, it will default to the latest block number)

And, `eth_getProof` will generate a merkle proof (it will give the necessary sibling hashes and the height of the block, that along with the signal, can rebuild the merkle storage root of the block you are asserting the signal exists in).

This means, assuming that the hashes which TaikoL1 and TaikoL2 maintain are correct, we can reliably send **cross-chain messages**.

Let's walk through an example:

1. First, we can send a message on some source chain, and store it on the signal service.
2. Next, we call `eth_getProof`, which will give us a proof that we did indeed send a message on the source chain.
3. Finally, we call `isSignalReceived` on the destination chain's SignalService which essentially just verifies the merkle proof. `isSignalReceived` will look up the block hash you are asserting you had stored a message on the source chain (where you originally sent the message), and with the sibling hashes inside the merkle proof it will rebuild the merkle root, which verifies the signal was included in that merkle root—meaning it was sent.

And boom! We have sent a cross-chain message. Confusing? Well leave some feedback please if it is, so we can clear it up.

## How does Ether bridging work?

Taiko's bridge utilizes the Signal Service we described. Here is the general user flow for Taiko's bridge:

1. The user sends their funds to the Bridge contract
2. The Bridge locks the Ether, and stores a message by calling `sendSignal(message)` on the SignalService contract
3. The user receives Ether on the destination chain, if they (or another) provide a valid merkle proof that the message was received on the source chain

## How does ERC-20 bridging work?

ERC-20 tokens originate from a canonical chain. To send a token and bridge it to the other chain, a new BridgedERC20 contract needs to be deployed on the destination chain. For example, the HORSE token's canonical chain is [deployed on Ethereum A1](https://l1explorer.a1.taiko.xyz/address/0x3E3a3416DbCc5cb4448B6b171fF15f9Da35Ab72d). To enable bridging to Taiko A1, there is also a BridgedERC20 contract for it [deployed on Taiko A1](https://l2explorer.a1.taiko.xyz/address/0xb8eA36284d1Fa062cc0c969E28a49f3531cFB1bf).

### Bridge from canonical chain to destination chain

Here are the overall steps for transferring canonical ERC-20 from a source chain to the destination chain:

1. A contract for the ERC-20 must first be deployed on the destination chain

2. Call sendERC20 on the source chain TokenVault, this will **transfer** the amount by using the `safeTransferFrom` function on the canonical ERC-20 contract, on the source chain, to the TokenVault.

3. Send a message to the Signal Service (on the source chain), this message will contain some metadata related to the bridge request, but most importantly it includes the calldata for the `receiveERC20` method.

4. Process the message on the destination chain by submitting a merkle proof (generated from the source chain), proving that a message is included in the state of the source chain Signal Service. After verifying this occurred and doing some checks, it will attempt to invoke the `receiveERC20` method encoded in the message. This will **mint** ERC-20 on the BridgedERC20 contract to the `to` address on the destination chain!

### Bridge from destination chain back to the canonical chain

Okay now let's do the reverse, how do we transfer a bridged token from a source chain to the destination chain?

1. A contract for the ERC-20 already exists on the canonical chain, so no need to deploy a new one.
2. Call sendERC20 on the source chain TokenVault, this will **burn** the ERC-20 on the BridgedERC20 contract.
3. Send a message to the Signal Service (on the source chain), this message will contain some metadata related to the bridge request, but most importantly it includes the calldata for the `receiveERC20` method.
4. Process the message on the destination chain by submitting a merkle proof (generated from the source chain), proving that a message is included in the state of the source chain Signal Service. After verifying this occurred and doing some checks, it will attempt to invoke the `receiveERC20` method encoded in this message. This will **transfer** the amount from the destination chain TokenVault to the `to` address on the destination chain.
