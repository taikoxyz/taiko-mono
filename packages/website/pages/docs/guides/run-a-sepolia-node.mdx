# Run a Sepolia node

This guide will help you get a Sepolia archive node up and running.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) is installed and **running**.
- [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git/) is installed.
- If using Windows, you should install [Git BASH](https://gitforwindows.org/) or [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to use as your terminal.
- As of `2023-06-21` a full archive node sync takes **326 GB** with geth + lighthouse. Consult the hardware requirements of the execution + consensus clients you are using.

## Steps

<Steps>
### Clone eth-docker
```bash
git clone https://github.com/eth-educators/eth-docker
cd eth-docker
```

### Enable archive node

First, copy `default.env` to `.env`:

```
cp default.env .env
```

Next, open the `.env` file in your preferred text editor and set:

```
ARCHIVE_NODE=true
```

### Expose RPC ports

To expose the node's RPC ports (for a Taiko L2 node to make calls to it), you can append `el-shared.yml` to the list of files in the `COMPOSE_FILE` variable in your `.env` file:

```bash /el-shared.yml/
COMPOSE_FILE=lighthouse-cl-only.yml:geth.yml:el-shared.yml
```

Keep in mind this is **not encrypted**, so you should not expose it to the internet. eth-docker offers a few other options that you can read about [here](https://eth-docker.net/Usage/Advanced#sharing-rpc-and-rest-ports).

### Complete the eth-docker quickstart

Complete the [eth-docker quickstart](https://eth-docker.net/Usage/QuickStart/). You will need to run the config command:

```bash
./ethd config
```

After setting up the config, start the Execution Layer and Consensus Layer clients with admin permission

```bash
./ethd up
```

### Check your connection

Check if the Execution Layer client is connected to Sepolia (change port from `8545` to whatever you have the execution client p2p port set to in your `.env` file)

```bash
curl http://localhost:8545 \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"method":"eth_chainId","params":[],"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}'
```

which should return chainId = 0xaa36a7 = 11155111

```json
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "result": "0xaa36a7" }
```

Wait for your Consensus Layer client to fully sync by checking

```bash
./ethd logs -f consensus
```

Check if the Execution Layer client is synced by requesting the latest Sepolia block from the Execution Layer client

```bash
curl http://localhost:8545 \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}'
```

If your response block number is less than the current block, check the Execution Layer client logs:

```bash
./ethd logs -f execution
```

and wait to sync for the latest block as shown here on [Sepolia's Etherscan Blocks](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/blocks).

<Callout type="warning">
If you get the following error after running the curl command:

```bash
curl: (7) failed to connect to localhost port 8545 after 0 ms: connection refused
```

make sure that your Execution Layer client ports are setup by updating `COMPOSE_FILE` to include `el-shared.yml` as described in step `Expose RPC ports`.

</Callout>

### Harden your network (optional)

This is important especially if you `ssh` into machine or open ports to the internet (be careful about that). Here are some recommended resources:
