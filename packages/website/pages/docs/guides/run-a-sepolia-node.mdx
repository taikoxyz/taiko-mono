# Run a Sepolia node

## Overview

This guide will help you get a Sepolia archive node up and running.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) is installed and **running**.
- [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git/) is installed.
- As of `2023-06-21T16:59:11+00:00` a full archive node sync takes **207.3 GB** with geth + lighthouse. Consult the hardware requirements of the execution + consensus clients you are using. 

## Steps

<Steps>
### Clone eth-docker
```sh
git clone https://github.com/eth-educators/eth-docker
cd eth-docker
```

### Enable archive mode

First, copy `default.env` to `.env`:
```
cp default.env .env
```

Next, open the `.env` file in your preferred text editor and set:
```filename=e
ARCHIVE_NODE=true
```

### Complete the eth-docker quickstart

### Harden your network

This is important especially if you `ssh` into machine or open ports to the internet (be careful about that). Here are some recommended resources:
