Taiko's network is fully decentralized and relies on the community to run nodes. This guide will walk you through the process of operating a Taiko node via [simple-taiko-node](https://github.com/taikoxyz/simple-taiko-node), the easiest way to get started operating a Taiko node. With simple-taiko-node you can:

- Run a Taiko node easily from the command line on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
- Run a Taiko node regularly or as a prover.
- View a [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) dashboard which displays the node's status.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) is installed and **running**.
- [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git/) is installed.
- Should have some ETH on the Sepolia network (see [request from faucet](/docs/guides/request-from-faucet)) if running a prover.
- Because we use a fork of geth, you can consult the [geth minimum requirements](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum#hardware-requirements), with the exception of 1TB of free space, as the Taiko rollup state is much smaller.
  - If you are running a prover, 32GB of RAM and 8 cores is recommended.

## Steps

<Steps>
### Clone simple-taiko-node
```sh
git clone https://github.com/taikoxyz/simple-taiko-node.git
cd simple-taiko-node
```

### Configure your node as a prover (optional)

First, copy the `.env.sample` to a new file `.env`:

```sh
cp .env.sample .env
```

Then, open the `.env` file in your preferred text editor:

{" "}
<Tabs items={["Mac", "Linux", "Windows"]} defaultIndex="0">
  <Tab>```sh nano .env ```</Tab>
  <Tab>```sh vim .env ```</Tab>
  <Tab>```sh notepad .env ```</Tab>
</Tabs>

Finally, set the following environment variables to configure your node: 
    - Set `ENABLE_PROVER` to `true` (replacing the default `false` with `true`). 
    - Set `L1_PROVER_PRIVATE_KEY` to that of your wallet's private key; it will need some balance on Sepolia to prove blocks (if using MetaMask, follow these directions to [retrieve the private key](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key)).

### Start a node

<Callout>
If this is the first time starting the node, it may take some time to synchronize from the genesis block. You can monitor this progress through logs, or in the local grafana dashboard and see the latest L2 chain status in the [Taiko alpha-2 block explorer](https://explorer.a2.taiko.xyz/).
</Callout>

Make sure Docker is running and then run the following command to start the node. If you want to run it in the background, please add the `-d` flag (`docker compose up -d`).

```sh
docker compose up
```

To run the node in the background (detached mode), use the `-d` flag:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

### Stop a node

This command shuts down the node, but will keep all volumes, so next time you restart the node, it won't need to synchronize from the genesis again.

```sh
docker compose down
```

### View the node's logs

To view the Docker logs, the following commands can be ran:

**View all logs**

```sh
docker compose logs -f
```

**View the prover image's logs

```sh
docker compose logs -f taiko_client_prover
```

**View the L2 execution engine logs**

```sh
docker compose logs -f l2_execution_engine
```

**View the live data streams of your running containers (CPU/MEM USAGE %), and consumption of your machine's resources (add prefix "`docker stats -a`" to display all containers)**

```sh
docker stats
```


### View the node's status dashboard

A [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) dashboard with a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) datasource is also included to display the L2 execution engine's real time status. You can visit it at [http://localhost:3000/d/L2ExecutionEngine/l2-execution-engine-overview?orgId=1&refresh=10s](http://localhost:3000/d/L2ExecutionEngine/l2-execution-engine-overview?orgId=1&refresh=10s).

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

**Remove a node**

```sh
docker compose down -v
rm -f .env
```

These commands completely remove the node by removing all volumes used by each container. You should try this first.

**Error Messages**

When running a node it's normal for the node to run into errors. This doesn't mean that your node isn't working correctly, as most of the time the node resolves the errors. Some errors are there for the developers to easily debug if something goes wrong, but can be ignored by users. The following table explains some error messages a bit more.

**Unclean Shutdown**

When running a Node, you will need to ensure a clean shutdown by running the command `docker compose down`

If the node is being ran with `docker compose up` (without the `-d` flag) and the logs are displaying in the terminal, then Press CTRL+C to allow Docker to clean up the resources.

Please try running the following:

```sh
docker compose down -v
git pull
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```
