# Bridge tokens

<Callout type="warning">
  The BLL token is **expected to fail** about 50% of the time when
  bridging--this is done intentionally to test error handling.
</Callout>

## Overview

This guide will help you use the bridge to send tokens between Taiko testnets and their base chains. You can read more about how bridging works [here](/docs/concepts/bridging).

## Prerequisites

- A wallet with some testnet ETH on Sepolia or a Taiko testnet (you can [receive tokens here](/docs/guides/receive-tokens)).

## Steps

<Steps>
    ### Visit a bridge
    There two bridges, one if for bridging between Sepolia L1 and Grimsvotn L2, and the other is for bridging between Grimsvotn L2 and Eldfell L3. Try them out here:
    - [Sepolia L1 ↔ Grimsvotn L2 bridge](https://bridge.test.taiko.xyz/)
    - [Grimsvotn L2 ↔ Eldfell L3 bridge](https://bridge.l3test.taiko.xyz)

    ### Bridge tokens
    Try bridging tokens between testnets by selecting them from the dropdown. You can also manually claim the transfer yourself by clicking the "Claim" button under the "Transactions" tab (but **only** if you already have some ETH on the destination chain).
