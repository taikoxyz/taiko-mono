These steps will help you connect your wallet to the Taiko testnet. There are two networks to configure your wallet with: **Ethereum (Sepolia)** and **Taiko (Askja)**.

## Prerequisites

- Have a wallet installed and ready to use. Some examples are MetaMask and Frame. Please use a hot wallet (not a hardware wallet) for this guide, preferably a throwaway wallet.

## Steps

1. Try clicking the buttons below to automatically add the networks to your wallet (using `wallet_addEthereumChain`).
2. Add the Sepolia testnet by clicking "Add chain" on [https://chainlist.wtf/](https://chainlist.wtf).
3. Add the Taiko network by clicking the "Add chain" button: <AddEthereumChainButton buttonText="Add chain" />
4. If that doesn't work, manually add the networks to your wallet using the [RPC configuration](/docs/reference/rpc-configuration).
