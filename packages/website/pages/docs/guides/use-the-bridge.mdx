  The BLL token should succeed when **minting** from the faucet, and when **sending the bridge message** to Sepolia or Taiko. However, it will fail about 50% of the time when **claiming** on Sepolia—this is intentionally done so we can test the error handling.
</Callout>


This guide will help you use the bridge to send tokens between Sepolia and Taiko (Askja testnet). You can read more about how bridging works [here](/docs/concepts/bridging#what-is-the-taiko-bridge).

> The HORSE token and BLL token are both dummy test tokens that are used for testing the bridge and swap.

## Prerequisites

- A wallet with some testnet ETH on Sepolia and/or Taiko (you can [receive tokens here](/docs/guides/receive-tokens)).

## Steps

<Steps>
    ### Visit the bridge
    Visit the [bridge](https://bridge.a2.taiko.xyz/) and the UI should be intuitive.

    ### Bridge tokens from Sepolia to Taiko
    Try bridging ETH, HORSE, and/or BLL from Sepolia to Taiko. You can also try manually claiming the transfer yourself by clicking the "Claim" button under the "Transactions" tab.
