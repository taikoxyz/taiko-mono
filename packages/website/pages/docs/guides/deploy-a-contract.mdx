## Overview

This guide will help you deploy a smart contract to Taiko using Foundry or Hardhat.

## Prerequisites

- You have [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) or [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started#quick-start) installed.
- You have testnet ETH on Taiko (to pay the transaction fee for deploying the contract).
   - You can [request Sepolia ETH](/docs/guides/receive-tokens) from the faucet and then [use the bridge](/docs/guides/use-the-bridge) to send the testnet ETH to Taiko.
- You have the private key to the account with testnet ETH on Taiko.

### Additional Remix prerequisites
- You have [configured your wallet](/docs/guides/configure-your-wallet) to connect to Taiko.

   ### Create a project with Foundry
   ```sh
   forge init hello_foundry && cd hello_foundry
   ```

   ### Deploy your contract
   Deploy the contract located at `src/Counter.sol`. Replace `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY` below with your private key which has some testnet ETH on Taiko.
   <Callout type="warning">
   Use a throwaway wallet to be safe. Don't reveal the private key of a wallet with significant value!
   </Callout>

   ```sh
   forge create --rpc-url https://rpc.internal.taiko.xyz --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY src/Counter.sol:Counter
   ```

   ### View your contract
   Paste the address from the output into the [Taiko block explorer](https://explorer.internal.taiko.xyz) and verify that the contract was deployed.
