This guide will help you deploy a smart contract to Taiko (Askja testnet) using Foundry.

## Prerequisites

- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) is installed.
- You have the private key handy to an account that has testnet ETH on Taiko (to pay the transaction fee for deploying the contract).
   - [Retrieve private key with MetaMask](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key#:~:text=On%20the%20account%20page%2C%20click,click%20%E2%80%9CConfirm%E2%80%9D%20to%20proceed.).
   - [Generate wallet keys with OpenSSL](https://gist.github.com/miguelmota/3793b160992b4ea0b616497b8e5aee2f).
   - [Generate wallet keys with ethereumjs-wallet](https://piyopiyo.medium.com/how-to-generate-ethereum-private-key-and-address-in-local-offline-environment-90294308593c).
- Have some testnet ETH on Taiko:
   - First, [request Sepolia ETH](/guides/receive-tokens) from the faucet.
   - Then, [use the bridge](/docs/guides/use-the-bridge) to send the testnet ETH to Taiko.

## Steps

<Steps>
   ### Create a project with Foundry
   ```sh
   forge init hello_foundry && cd hello_foundry
   ```

   ### Deploy the contract
   Deploy the contract located at `src/Counter.sol`. Replace `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY` below with your private key which has some testnet ETH on Taiko.
   > Note: The `--legacy` flag is needed because EIP-1559 is currently disabled on Taiko—it will be re-enabled in the future.
   ```sh
   forge create --legacy --rpc-url https://rpc.a2.taiko.xyz --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY src/Counter.sol:Counter
   ```

   ### View your contract
   Paste the address from the output into the [Taiko block explorer](https://explorer.a2.taiko.xyz) and verify that the contract was deployed.
