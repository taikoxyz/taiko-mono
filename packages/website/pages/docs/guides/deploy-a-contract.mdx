# Deploy a contract

This guide will help you deploy a smart contract to Taiko.

## Prerequisites

- You have testnet ETH on Taiko (to pay the transaction fee for deploying the contract).
  - You can [request Sepolia ETH](/docs/guides/receive-tokens#receive-sepolia-eth) from the faucet and then [use the bridge](/docs/guides/bridge-tokens) to send testnet ETH to Taiko.
- You have the private key to the account with testnet ETH on Taiko.

### Additional Remix prerequisites

- You have [setup your wallet](/docs/guides/setup-your-wallet) to connect to the relevant testnets.

      **1. Visit the Remix website**
      Visit [remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org).

      **2. Select a smart contract**
      ![select a smart contract](/images/guides/deploy-remix/select.png)

      **3. Compile your smart contract**
      ![compile your smart contract](/images/guides/deploy-remix/compile.png)


      **4. Deploy your smart contract**

  <Tab>
      **1. Install Foundry**

      See the [Foundry installation guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).

      **2. Create a project with Foundry**

      ```sh
      forge init hello_foundry && cd hello_foundry
      ```

      **3. Deploy your contract**

      Deploy the contract located at `src/Counter.sol`. Replace `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY` below with your private key which has some testnet ETH on Taiko.

      <Callout type="warning">
      Use a throwaway wallet to be safe. Don't reveal the private key of a wallet
      with significant value!
      </Callout>

      ```sh
      forge create --rpc-url https://rpc.jolnir.taiko.xyz --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY src/Counter.sol:Counter
      ```

      **4. View your contract**

      Paste the address from the output into the [Taiko block explorer](https://explorer.jolnir.taiko.xyz) and verify that the contract was deployed.

  <Tab>
      **1. Create a project with Hardhat**

      ```sh
      npx hardhat
      ```

      **2. Add Taiko to your Hardhat config**
      <Callout type="warning">
      For the `accounts` array, you will need to enter the private key of the account you are deploying the contract with. It is **not recommended** to hardcode the private key like this (an environment variable would be better, but is still risky).

      Use a throwaway wallet to be safe. Don't reveal the private key of a wallet with significant value!
      </Callout>

      ```ts {6-13} filename=hardhat.config.ts
      import { HardhatUserConfig } from "hardhat/config";
      import "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox";

      const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
         solidity: "0.8.18",
         networks: {
            taiko: {
               url: "https://rpc.jolnir.taiko.xyz",
               accounts: [
                  "0xf214f2b2cd398c806f84e317254e0f0b801d0643303237d97a22a48e01628897",
               ],
            },
         },
      };

      export default config;
      ```

      **3. Deploy your contract on Taiko**

      ```sh
      npx hardhat run --network taiko scripts/deploy.ts
      ```

      **4. View your contract**
      Paste the address from the output into the Taiko block explorer and verify that the contract was deployed.

      **1. Deploy your smart contract using thirdweb deploy**

      Create a basic Hardhat project.

      Follow the documentation: https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/guides/project-setup
      
      Install the thirdweb CLI by executing the command 

      ```bash
      npm i thirdweb
      ```
      Create a basic smart contract.

      For example:

      ```bash
      // SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
      pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

      contract Storage {
          address payable public owner;
          uint256 public num;

          event Stored(uint amount);

          constructor() payable {
              owner = payable(msg.sender);
          }

          function StoreNum(uint256 _num) public{
              num=_num;
              emit Stored(num);
          }
        
        }
      ```

      Navigate to the root directory of your project and execute the following command:

      ```bash
      npx thirdweb deploy
      ```

      Executing this command will trigger the following actions:

      - Compiling the contracts in the current directory.
      - Providing the option to select which contract(s) you wish to deploy.
      - Uploading your contract source code (ABI) to IPFS.
      - Directly navigate you to a dashboard interface which will open in your default browser.

      **2. Dashboard interface**

      ![Deploy interface](/images/guides/deploy-thirdweb/thirdweb-deploy.png)

      - Click on the connect wallet button on the dashboard and connect your metamask wallet that has testnet ETH on Taiko jolnir L2.
      - Select the network as **`Taiko Jolnir L2`**
      - Click on **`Deploy Now`** button.
      - This will intiate a transaction to deploy the contract on Taiko Jolnir L2 

        ![transaction](/images/guides/deploy-thirdweb/thirdweb-transaction.png)

      - After completing the transaction it will request you to sign a message to create a dashboard interface for you smart contract.

        ![sign message](/images/guides/deploy-thirdweb/thirdweb-message.png)

      - Now your contract is deployed on the Taiko Jolnir L2.

        ![sign message](/images/guides/deploy-thirdweb/thirdweb-dashboard.png)

      For additional information on Deploy, please reference [thirdweb’s documentation](https://portal.thirdweb.com/deploy?utm_source=taiko&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=chain_docs).
