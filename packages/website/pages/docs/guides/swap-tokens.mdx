## Overview

## Steps

<Steps>
    ### Navigate to Swap

## Troubleshooting

### Token list does not show up
If the "Taiko Tokens List" does not show up at "Select a list", you can add [this token list](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/d1onys1us/8f8824daed0882b1094296f824fae53c/raw/15204c4a4927a7f48a78c195323ce0d573d6b7c0/taiko_tokens.json).
