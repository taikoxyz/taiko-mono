<Callout type="warning">
  Keep in mind that running a prover is a very competitive space, and those who
  generate proofs will have very powerful machines and optimized clients. It's
  unlikely to prove a block and gain rewards with the default client and minimum
  hardware requirements.

# Enable a prover

This guide will help you enable your Taiko node as a prover. Read more about prover dynamics [here](/docs/concepts/proving#prover-dynamics) (especially to set your expectations about running a prover).

## Prerequisites

- You have already setup a node (see: [Run a node](/docs/guides/run-a-node))
- Must have some ETH on Sepolia (see: [Receive tokens](/docs/guides/receive-tokens)).
- Should have at least 8/16 core CPU and 32GB of RAM.

## Steps

<Steps>
### Open `.env` file in `simple-taiko-node`
Open the `.env` file in the `simple-taiko-node` directory.

### Set environment variables to enable prover

<Callout type="warning">
  Do **not** use a private key that is valuable to you. The private key will be
  stored in plain text in the `.env` file, and this is not secure. There is a
  real risk of losing your assets. You should **only use a test account**.
</Callout>

Set the following environment variables to enable your node as a prover:

- Set `ENABLE_PROVER` to `true` (replacing the default `false` with `true`).
- Set `L1_PROVER_PRIVATE_KEY` to that of your wallet's private key; it will need some ETH on Sepolia to prove blocks (if using MetaMask, follow these directions to [retrieve the private key](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key)).

### Stake your TTKOe (Eldfell L3 provers only)

If you are trying to run a prover for Eldfell L3 first keep in mind, the competition for getting into the prover pool will be high. But don't worry! Even if you get slashed, there's nothing wrong with that. TTKOe is a worthless testnet token, and even getting slashed really helps us to test the network.

To stake your TTKOe try using the [staking dashboard](https://staking.l3test.taiko.xyz/) or the base layer contract manually (see [TaikoL1](/docs/reference/contract-addresses)).

### Verify prover logs

Verify you have some prover logs:

- `💰 Your block proof was accepted` means you are the first prover and receive the reward.
- `✅ Valid block proven` just means a proposed block was successfully proved on TaikoL1 (by anyone).

If you are running a node in the background, you can view the logs with `docker compose logs -f`.

</Steps>

Consult [Run a node - Troubleshooting](/docs/guides/run-a-node#troubleshooting) for common issues.
