# Enable a prover

This guide will help you enable your Taiko node as a prover. Read more about prover dynamics [here](/docs/concepts/proving#prover-dynamics).

## Prerequisites

- You have already setup a node (see: [Run a node](/docs/guides/run-a-node))
- Should have at least 8/16 core CPU and 32GB of RAM.
- Must have a balance of ETH on Sepolia L1 (see: [Receive tokens](/docs/guides/receive-tokens)).

## Steps

<Steps>
### Open the .env file in `simple-taiko-node`

```sh
nano .env
```

### Set environment variables to enable prover

<Callout type="warning">
  Do **not** use a private key that is valuable to you. The private key will be
  stored in plain text in the `.env` and this is not secure. There is a real
  risk of losing your assets. You should **only use a test account**.
</Callout>

Open the `.env` file and set the following environment variables to enable your node as a prover:

- Set `ENABLE_PROVER` to `true`
- Set `L1_PROVER_PRIVATE_KEY` to your L1 account private key (with balance of TTKOj on TaikoL1)

### Verify prover logs

Run this command to verify you have some prover logs:

```sh
docker compose logs -f taiko_client_prover_relayer | egrep "block proof was|proof submission error|Block proven"
```

You should see logs like this if it was successful:

- `💰 Your block proof was accepted` means you successfully submitted a proof and your bond is returned.
- `✅ Block proven` means a proposed block was successfully proved on TaikoL1 (by anyone).

You can check all commands to see prover logs in the [node runner manual](/docs/manuals/node-runner-manual#view-client-prover-relayer-logs).

### Register your prover (optionally)

Add your prover to the [prover registration page](/docs/reference/prover-market.mdx) so that other block proposers can find your prover and request bonds.
