# Enable a proposer

This guide will help you enable your Taiko node as a proposer.

## Prerequisites

- You have already setup a node (see: [Run a node](/docs/guides/run-a-taiko-node)).
- Must have a balance of ETH on Sepolia L1 (see: [Receive tokens](/docs/guides/receive-tokens)).
- Access to either a local prover (see: [Enable a prover](/docs/guides/enable-a-prover)) or an outsourced prover from the [prover market](/docs/reference/prover-market-page). Read more about the proof design [here](/docs/concepts/proving).

## Steps

<Steps>

### Open .env file in `simple-taiko-node`

```sh
nano .env
```

### Set environment variables to enable a proposer

<Callout type="warning">
  Do **not** use a private key that is valuable to you. The private key will be
  stored in plain text in the `.env` file, and this is not secure. There is a
  real risk of losing your assets. You should **only use a test account**.
</Callout>

Set the following environment variables to enable your node as a proposer:

- Set `ENABLE_PROPOSER` to `true`
- Set `L1_PROPOSER_PRIVATE_KEY` to the private key of your L1 account (with balance) who will send TaikoL1.proposeBlock transactions
- Set `L2_SUGGESTED_FEE_RECIPIENT` to the address of your L2 account who will be the tx fee beneficiary of the L2 blocks that you proposed

### Set a prover market prover (needed if not running a prover locally)

Doing this is optional if you are already running a local prover. See [enable a prover](/docs/guides/enable-a-prover) for more information on how to set that up. By default the proposer will select your local prover to provide bonds for the proposed blocks.

If you are not running a local prover, then you can specify a prover from the [prover market](/docs/reference/prover-market-page) by overriding the default value for:

- `PROVER_ENDPOINTS`

### Verify proposer logs

Run this command to verify you have some proposer logs:

```sh
docker compose logs -f taiko_client_proposer | egrep "Propose transactions succeeded"
```

You should see a log if you have proposed a block: `📝 Propose transactions succeeded`.

You can check all commands to see proposer logs in the [node runner manual](/docs/manuals/node-runner-manual#view-client-proposer-logs).
