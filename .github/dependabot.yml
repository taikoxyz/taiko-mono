# Dependabot configuration for automated dependency updates.
# This file is the single source of truth and overrides any GitHub repo settings.
#
# Key features:
# - Monthly updates scheduled for Saturday 04:20 ET
# - Dependencies are grouped by ecosystem to minimize PR noise
# - Each group has designated reviewers and single PR limit
# - To ignore updates for a dependency, add to ecosystem's ignore field (and open
#   a GitHub issue if needed for tracking):
#   ignore:
#     - dependency-name: "golang.org/x/crypto"  # skip all crypto updates
