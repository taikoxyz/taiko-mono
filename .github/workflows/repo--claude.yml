            Perform a comprehensive code review of the changes in this pull request.

            For protocol(smart contract) changes always start in the `packages/protocol` directory.
            You MUST run `pnpm install --ignore-scripts` first for security (prevents malicious lifecycle scripts).
            You MUST follow the development workflow described in CLAUDE.md.
            You MUST make sure the tests are passing before creating a pull request.
            You MUST open a draft pull request after creating a branch.
            You MUST create a pull request after completing your task.
            You can create pull requests using the `mcp__github__create_pull_request` tool.

            Use top-level comments for the review. Leave out sections that have no relevance, for example if it is a documentation change testing may be irrelevant.
            Be constructive and helpful in your feedback. Don't be overly polite or verbose, be direct.
